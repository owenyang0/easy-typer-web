_DevStories is our brand-new series. We interview developers in our community to
understand how they build applications with QuestDB. For the first post of this
series, we are thrilled to interview
[Kevin Kamto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-kamto/), Co-founder at
[AthleteX Markets](https://www.athletex.io/)._

### Hi Kevin, could you tell us more about yourself?

My name is Kevin Kamto. I'm one of the core contributors and co-founders of
AthleteX Markets. That means that on a day to day basis, I operate as the head
of sales and point of coordination for the team.

### How did you get to know time series databases in the first place?

I've been working in the IoT space as a developer for many years. For a cool
project I worked on, we needed to create a device that measured the WiFi usage
in the company to observe the day to day patterns. That's when I got introduced
to InfluxDB, one of the time series database pioneers at that time.

### Tell us more about AthleteX Markets, what is this project about?

This is the backstory: during the middle of COVID-19, there were a lot of
markets seeing red. So we asked ourselves, what is an investor to do during this
time? As someone who loves sports like soccer and basketball, I thought that if
I could put my money towards an athlete, I could keep it safe.

The idea of AthleteX is that you can invest in the performance of your favorite
athletes. Essentially, we created a fantasy sports prediction market. You can go
to the platform to either long or short the performance of an athlete by trading
the Athlete Performance Tokens (APTs). The price of an APT is based on an
athlete's in-game statistics. Taking baseball as an example, we determine price
using the Wins Above Replacement (WAR) formula, and the price is updated in
real-time.

### How is the use case related to time series databases?

Using MLB (baseball) as an example, some in-game metrics such as bats and home
runs are generated every minute or every five minutes. We must store all that
information over time. Coming from an IoT background, the problem is not new to
me. So instead of going with something like MySQL or MongoDB, which didn't make
a lot of sense, I knew that a time series database was what we needed.

### Among all the available time series databases, why QuestDB?

QuestDB is faster than its competitors and goes above and beyond what we need it
to handle at the current stage. It's also convenient to use SQL as the query
language. At the moment, we store thousands of time series every minute and both
the ingestion and querying performance has been satisfying. At scale, we
anticipate hundreds of millions of data points and expect QuestDB to handle it
smoothly.

### Could you tell us more about the technical side of your use case and how QuestDB fits in?

QuestDB is the core foundation of our entire backend infrastructure. Due to the
feed-type nature of our application and the need to look up athlete stats very
fast, we need a database to manage large time series data sets while providing
fast query speed.

Our data providers have all the sports related data for each season, sport, and
player. And we have some Python scripts to grab all the data periodically,
[calculate the book value based on the WAR formula](https://athletex-markets.gitbook.io/athletex-huddle/start-here/litepaper/apt-price-ids),
and store it in QuestDB. QuestDB is the base layer that allows us to handle this
kind of throughput. At the moment, we're storing nearly 2 millions records in
QuestDB.

Further down in the data pipeline, we built an API using Kotlin to query QuestDB
and show the charts on our frontend. And from this point on, it's more about the
DeFi protocol than QuestDB, you can read
[our lite paper](https://athletex-markets.gitbook.io/athletex-huddle/start-here/litepaper)
to get a deeper understanding on how our system was designed.

### What are the most common queries you use for your application?

We often use simple `SELECT` statements together with `WITH` and `ORDER BY`. We
also dabbled with `SAMPLE BY` and the performance has been exemplary.

### Were there any challenges you ran into with QuestDB? And how did you overcome it?

We wanted to allow some users to query QuestDB directly using the web console or
some dashboards, without having access to drop or alter any tables. It was not
possible to do that directly since it's lacking a security layer or built-in
authentication. We ended up writing our own API for this purpose.

:::note

Insights from the QuestDB team: since
[QuestDB 6.3](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/6.3), we
implemented a new configuration `pg.security.readonly` to toggle the read-only
mode for PGWire. Similarily, the existing `http.security.readonly` can be
applied to the web console.

### What are some of the new features or functionalities you really look forward to in QuestDB? And why?

High availability is one thing we look forward to seeing in QuestDB. For now we
try to scale the resources with the single instance but it come at the expense
of some downtime. Replication is an important feature to ensure that the data is
echoed correctly across all the replicas.

We could also benefit a lot if QuestDB can work smoothly with Metabase or
something similar to that. We've tried to create dashboards with Grafana but it
doesn't appear to be as human friendly as products like Metabase, especially for
the non-technical end users that we have.
