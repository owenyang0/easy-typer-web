This release brings a new algorithm for the SQL `COPY` statement, which is
specifically designed to enable **fast and easy CSV Import for large and
unsorted data files**. This feature comes in handy when there's a need to
migrate a large amount of data from other databases to QuestDB
[[Guide: CSV import]](/docs/guides/importing-data). In addition, there are
several improvements and fixes for the Influx line protocol, Core, and SQL
engine.
