With the official launch of 6.0 just around the corner, we want to keep you up
to speed on our latest updates, news and content from recent weeks.

## QuestDB 6.0 alpha is out

We're happy to announce that the **alpha release** for **QuestDB 6.0** is now
available!

This release adds support for **out-of-order ingestion** **(O3)** on-the-fly and
as a result, does not enforce that records arrive in chronological order. O3
adds flexibility and efficiency of use to the system and provides compatibility
with the [Time Series Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) (TSBS)
which is used to reliably measure and compare the performance of time series
databases.

The goal is to get as much feedback on performance or issues so feel free to
reach out on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.io/) and let us know how the alpha is
running!
