We welcome contributions to our blog posts. This is a way for you to contribute
to the open source movement by writing technical content. We’re looking for
content that features technical subjects to help more developers to start
exploring and adopting QuestDB.

This page describes the process and guidelines for submitting tutorial ideas and
publishing content on our website.

## What can you write about?

We are looking for original content in generally these categories:

- Articles that explore topics related to time series analysis, time series
  databases, and their use cases, ideally covering QuestDB or with a focus on
  QuestDB.
- Step-by-step tutorials that walk the reader through creating a real-world
  project with QuestDB from start to finish. These can also cover topics related
  to using QuestDB with other relevant tools in different use cases.

  For instance, tutorials showing how to use QuestDB:

- "for storing IoT sensor data..." Member
- "for creating data visualizations..."
- "with an ML library..."
- "for monitoring an application..."

If there is a topic that you might find relevant for the QuestDB community but
doesn’t fall under the above categories, you can still submit your proposal and
we’ll review it.

## How does it work?

1. Explore QuestDB. Join our [Slack channel](https://slack.questdb.io/) to
   discuss and ask questions about QuestDB.
2. Raise a [GH issue](https://github.com/questdb/questdb.io/issues/new/choose)
   and follow the tutorial issue template to fill in a proposal with an outline.
3. We will review the information you provided to approve and assign you the
   article, or come back to you with relevant feedback.
4. Submit your pull request.
