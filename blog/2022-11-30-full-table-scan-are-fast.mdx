One of our core engineers, [Jaromir Hamala](https://twitter.com/jerrinot), was
inspired by an article comparing performance between index merging and composite
indexes. He conducted a similar test on QuestDB's table scanning strategy. In
this article, Jaromir explains the benefit of table scanning and shows the
superior query performance it brings.

## A Hacker News article: index merges and composite indexes

While browsing Hacker News, I stumbled upon an excellent article written by
Simon HÃ¸rup Eskildsen:
["Index Merges vs Composite Indexes in Postgres and MySQL"](https://sirupsen.com/index-merges).
Simon compares index performance for queries using a conjunction of two
attributes. This is a fancy way to say that an SQL query contains a predicate
similar to this:

```questdb-sql
WHERE attribute1 = 'foo' AND attribute2 = 'bar;
```

The article does multiple things exceptionally well:

- It describes different strategies a database engine can use to evaluate the
  query: composite indexes v.s. merging results from individual indexes.
- It shows systematic thinking about performance. It tries to estimate expected
  performance results based on the capabilities of modern hardware in
  combination with educated guesses about how a database likely works. I found
  this part incredibly fascinating. Reasoning about performance from first
  principles is more than just cool. It helps to build a better intuition and
  deeper understanding of our tools.
- It shows the actual results from MySQL and PostgreSQL, discusses how they
  differ from the expected results, and tries to explain the reasons. Again,
  very enlightening!

While reading the article, I wondered: how would QuestDB perform in this
scenario? My curiosity increased after reading a
[discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33765570) on Hacker News -
someone posted results from a similar query running on ClickHouse. So I thought
that it'd be interesting to do a similar one on QuestDB!

## To index or not index, that is the question

QuestDB - as many other analytical/OLAP databases - tends to rely on table scans
rather than index lookups. This is due to the nature of analytical queries: they
are typically more complex than OLTP queries and often touch a lot of data.

Table scanning also plays nicely with modern hardware: our hardware is
incredibly fast in everything sequential. Sequential memory access is MUCH
faster than random access. Sequential disk access allows deeper IO queues
resulting in better performance than random access. Sequential access also
offers optimization opportunities, such as using
[SIMD instructions](/blog/2020/04/02/using-simd-to-aggregate-billions-of-rows-per-second/)
to evaluate filters. Table scanning also means that there is no index to
maintain, and therefore the concurrency model is simpler. This allows the
[utilization of multiple threads](https://www.p99conf.io/session/building-efficient-multi-threaded-filters-for-faster-sql-queries/)
with very little inter-thread communication, which is costly. The simplicity
also translates into another advantage: a straightforward query plan can be
[Just-In-Time compiled into a native code](/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/),
increasing performance further.

## Testing time

I did what every curious software engineer would do: I started an EC2 instance,
unpacked QuestDB, and started poking it. Specifically, I created an
`m6a.8xlarge` instance with 32 vCPU and 128GB of RAM. That is not a bad machine,
it's probably better than most development workstations. On the other hand, it's
not a super beefy machine for a database server. I also asked AWS to use GP3 as
block storage, but that was it. No further tuning; even all GP3 parameters were
left on defaults.

QuestDB installation is effortless. [Download](https://questdb.io/get-questdb/)
a tarball, unzip, and start it:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/download/6.6.1/questdb-6.6.1-rt-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf ./questdb-6.6.1-rt-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ cd ./questdb-6.6.1-rt-linux-amd64/bin/
$ ./questdb.sh start
```

Then I used the builtin Web Console to create a table and populate it with data:

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE test_table (
  id long,
  text1 String,
  text2 String,
  int1000 long,
  int100 long,
  int10 long,
  int10_2 long
);

INSERT INTO test_table
  SELECT
  rnd_long(),
  rnd_str(1, 1024, 1024, 0),
  rnd_str(1, 255, 255, 0),
  rnd_long(0, 999, 0),
  rnd_long(0, 99, 0),
  rnd_long(0, 9, 0),
  rnd_long(0, 9, 0)

FROM long_sequence(10000000);
```

The `INSERT` query generates 10 million rows with random data roughly matching
the shape of the table and data from the original article.

And finally, the moment of truth: how fast will QuestDB run the aggregation with
the same filter? Will it be faster than PostgreSQL's composite index? Or at
least faster than MySQL's index merge? Will raw performance and mechanical
sympathy outperform smart indexes? Here is the result:

```questdb-sql
SELECT count(*)
  FROM test_table
  WHERE int100 = 1 AND int1000 = 1;
```

![Screenshot showing result time of 4.95 milliseconds](/img/blog/2022-11-30/result.png)

It shows the query execution time was just under 5 milliseconds! That is on par
with the best result in the [original blog](https://sirupsen.com/index-merges),
where PostgreSQL uses a composite index specialized for this shape of queries,
and it's better than all other results in the original post! Once again, QuestDB
does a full table scan. It does not use any fancy data structure to minimize the
number of reads. It's just raw power and algorithms written to use the best out
of your hardware.

The main advantage of this approach is clear: I did not have to prepare indexes
upfront and specialized them for a given shape of a query. I could run a query
filtering on a different combination of columns and the result would be very
similar. This is a huge advantage for ad-hoc queries, which are very common in
analytics.

## Are indexes useless?

This is not a serious comparison, as I do not know the hardware specs used in
the original post. Perhaps even more importantly, MySQL and PostgreSQL are very
different beasts from time-series/analytical databases. They make different
design and implementation trade-offs because they aim at different typical use
cases. So what is the point of this article? It's simple:

1. I wanted to satisfy my own curiosity :smile:
2. I wanted to show how amazingly fast modern hardware is when we - the
   developers - are not sabotaging its inner working. Once again, The database
   scanned 10M rows in less than 5 ms, and I still find it incredible!

This is not to say indexes have no place in analytical databases. They still do:
an index with great selectivity (think of a unique index) will outperform full
table scans. Sparse indexes can be cheaper to maintain and help avoid scanning
chunks of data. This can be very relevant in architectures where hot data is
kept on fast local SSDs while cold data is kept on cheaper storages such as AWS
S3. If an index can be used to avoid copying data from a cold storage then it's
a performance (and cost!) win, too.

## Further experiments

QuestDB is running a [public demo](https://demo.questdb.io/) where you can
explore various datasets. My favorite example of a raw sequential performance is
this super simple aggregation:

```questdb-sql
SELECT avg(trip_distance) FROM trips;
```

It aggregates 1.6B rows in under 0.5s! When I saw it for the first time, I
assumed it must have been cached. Well, it's not. It's mechanical sympathy in
practice!
