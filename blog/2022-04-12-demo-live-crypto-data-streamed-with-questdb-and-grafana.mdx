At QuestDB we are all about performance. To showcase querying capabilities of
the database we have been running a live demo of historical taxi rides in NYC with 1.6 billion rows  <sup>[1]</sup> and a geospatial dataset that contains the locations of 250k unique ships <sup>[2]</sup> moving over time. You can analyze this dataset with SQL on our [live instance](https://demo.questdb.io/) and see how fast each query is processed. Today, we introduce a new dataset on the same demo instance: crypto market
data ingested in real-time from the Coinbase Exchange. For ingestion, we use a
convenient Python library [Cryptofeed](https://github.com/bmoscon/cryptofeed), a
cryptocurrency exchange feed handler that supports QuestDB. And for
visualization, we use Grafana to create interactive live charts, which refresh
every 5 seconds.

<!--truncate-->

We ingest the following columns into QuestDB in real-time for each BTC-USD and
ETH-USD trades coming through the Coinbase Exchange:

- price
- side (buy/sell)
- amount
- timestamp

To get you started, we added a set of example queries in the live demo of
QuestDB web console. These pre-written queries leverage the standard SQL syntax
and time-series SQL extensions in QuestDB. When clicking on a query, it's
automatically added to the SQL editor. Then, click the <kbd>Run</kbd> button or
press <kbd>F9</kbd> to execute the query. Despite the large amount of data
stored on the demo instance, the queries should come back in milliseconds!

Let's go through these sample queries one by one.

## Last prices of BTC and ETH

To find out the latest prices of BTC and ETH in USD. We use the
[`LATEST ON`](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/latest-on) syntax, which is
native to QuestDB's SQL Engine:

<p>

  ```questdb-sql title="Latest BTC and ETH prices"
  SELECT * FROM trades
  WHERE symbol in ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')
  LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol;
  ```

  <DemoConsoleButton
    href="https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20%2a%20FROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20symbol%20in%20%28%27BTC-USD%27%2C%20%27ETH-USD%27%29%0ALATEST%20ON%20timestamp%20PARTITION%20BY%20symbol%3B"
  />
</p>

Below is a real-time chart for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices with a time sample of 10
seconds.

## Candle chart sampled by time

This query returns open, close, minimal and maximal prices as well as cumulated
volumes with 15-minute intervals. We use the
[`SAMPLE BY`](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/) syntax, which
aggregates time series data into homogeneous time chunks:

<p>

  ```questdb-sql title="Candle chart with 15-minute intervals"
  SELECT 
      timestamp,
      first(price) AS open,
      last(price) AS close,
      min(price),
      max(price),
      sum(amount) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())
  SAMPLE BY 15m ALIGN TO CALENDAR;
  ```

  <DemoConsoleButton
    href="https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20%0A%20%20%20%20timestamp%2C%0A%20%20%20%20first%28price%29%20AS%20open%2C%0A%20%20%20%20last%28price%29%20AS%20close%2C%0A%20%20%20%20min%28price%29%2C%0A%20%20%20%20max%28price%29%2C%0A%20%20%20%20sum%28amount%29%20AS%20volume%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20symbol%20%3D%20%27BTC-USD%27%20AND%20timestamp%20%3E%20dateadd%28%27d%27%2C%20-1%2C%20now%28%29%29%0ASAMPLE%20BY%2015m%20ALIGN%20TO%20CALENDAR%3B"
  />
</p>

This real-time chart on Grafana plots the candle chart with a time sample of 10
seconds. We also show the volume traded on a secondary axis.

## VWAP Bitcoin price sampled by time

For each 15 minutes interval, we calculate the average price of BTC-USD adjusted
for the volume of trades during that period. This query includes the
[`WHERE`](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/where/) clause that is
accelerated by our new JIT Compiler (see the _lightning_ in the logs). And once
again, we downsample the dataset using `SAMPLE BY`.

<p>

  ```questdb-sql title="Volume-weighted average price"
  SELECT 
      timestamp,
      sum(price * amount) / sum(amount) AS vwap_price,
      sum(amount) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())
  SAMPLE BY 15m ALIGN TO CALENDAR;
  ```

  <DemoConsoleButton
    href="https://demo.questdb.io/?query=SELECT%20%0A%20%20%20%20timestamp%2C%0A%20%20%20%20sum%28price%20%2a%20amount%29%20%2F%20sum%28amount%29%20AS%20vwap_price%2C%0A%20%20%20%20sum%28amount%29%20AS%20volume%0AFROM%20trades%0AWHERE%20symbol%20%3D%20%27BTC-USD%27%20AND%20timestamp%20%3E%20dateadd%28%27d%27%2C%20-1%2C%20now%28%29%29%0ASAMPLE%20BY%2015m%20ALIGN%20TO%20CALENDAR%3B"
  />

The following real-time chart displays the distribution of trades based on their
size and paints a more granular picture of volume traded.

## Implied BTC-ETH exchange rate

The two series of prices for BTC-USD and ETH-USD have different unique
timestamps. In order to join these two series where timestamps do not exactly
match, use the `ASOF JOIN` syntax and then divide the price of BTC-USD with the
price of ETH-USD to get the implied BTC/ETH rate.

<p>

  ```questdb-sql title="Implied BTC-ETH exchange rate"
  WITH btc AS (
    SELECT timestamp AS x, price AS btcusd
    FROM trades
    WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('m', -30, now())
  ),
  eth AS (
    SELECT timestamp AS y, price AS ethusd
    FROM trades
    WHERE symbol = 'ETH-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('m', -30, now())
  )
  SELECT
    x AS time,
    btcusd / ethusd AS crossPrice,
    btcusd,
    ethusd
  FROM btc
  ASOF JOIN eth;
  ```

The following real-time chart plots three series: BTC-USD, ETH-USD and the
implied BTC-ETH cross price.
