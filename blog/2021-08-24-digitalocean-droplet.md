We're happy to announce that QuestDB is available with an official listing on
the DigitalOcean marketplace. Deploying QuestDB via 1-click app means it's quick
and easy to get started with a high-performance SQL database for time series. In
this announcement, we'll show you how to get started and show how you can make
use of some free DigitalOcean credit for new users.

## The DigitalOcean marketplace

DigitalOcean is a platform with software listings from independent vendors that
run on cloud resources. You can launch virtual private servers (VPS) called
"Droplets", which use KVM as the hypervisor and can be created in various sizes,
in 13 different data center regions and with various options out of the box,
including 6 Linux distributions and over 100 1-Click applications.

Launching QuestDB via the DigitalOcean marketplace allows you to configure the
latest QuestDB version as a Droplet with the configuration of your choosing such
as:

- The geographic region of your choice
- Persistent block storage
- Monitoring
- Credentials management for remote access (SSH)
- Backups
- Networking and VPC configuration

## How to create a QuestDB droplet

QuestDB is available on DigitalOcean through **1-Click Apps** reviewed by their
staff. Setup using this method is quite easy and can be performed in a few short
steps:

1. Navigate to the
   [QuestDB listing](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/questdb?refcode=50d6b551562b)
   on DigitalOcean
2. Click **Create QuestDB Droplet**
3. Select the basic plan for your Droplet (4GB RAM is recommended)

4. Choose a region closest to you
5. At the **Authentication** section, enter your SSH public key, or set a
   password
6. Set a hostname for the droplet such as `questdb-demo`
7. Leave all other settings with their defaults, and click **Create Droplet** at
   the bottom of the page

After 30 seconds, QuestDB should be ready to use. To validate that we set
everything up successfully, copy the Droplet's IP address by clicking on it and
navigate to `http://<IP ADDRESS>:9000/` where `<IP ADDRESS>` is the IP address
you just copied. The interactive console should load and we can start querying
the database and inserting data.

More details on deploying the droplet, along with information on securing the
instance and the interfaces that are exposed can be found on the
[DigitalOcean deploy guide](/docs/deployment/digitalocean).

## Get started with QuestDB on DigitalOcean

If you are new to DigitalOcean and don't have an account yet, we are happy to be
able to offer 100 USD of free credit to users who sign up using the
[the QuestDB referral link](https://m.do.co/c/50d6b551562b). With this offer,
anyone can try out QuestDB on DigitalOcean for free and evaluate using droplets
for storing and analyzing time series data.

And if you're looking for inspiration on how to make use of the new QuestDB
droplet, our community contributor GÃ¡bor Boros has written an excellent tutorial
showing how to deploy QuestDB as a 1-Click application. The example stack uses
Telegraf clients that collect system metrics from multiple DigitalOcean droplets
and streams this monitoring information to a QuestDB instance for analysis and
visualization. Check out the
[QuestDB on DigitalOcean tutorial](/blog/2021/07/09/telegraf-and-questdb-for-storing-metrics-in-a-timeseries-database)
to get started.
