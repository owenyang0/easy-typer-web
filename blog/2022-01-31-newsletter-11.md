## Just-in-Time compiler

In QuestDB 6.2, our engineering team brings you a brand new **JIT (Just-in-Time)
compiler** as a part of the SQL engine. The compiler aims to significantly
improve the execution time for queries with simple arithmetic expressions used
to filter your data.

It took us 11,000+ lines of code, 250+ commits, and many cups of coffee to ship
this, and we've documented
[the story behind it in a blog post](/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/).

## QuestDB Cloud

A new page for QuestDB Cloud is now available on our website,
