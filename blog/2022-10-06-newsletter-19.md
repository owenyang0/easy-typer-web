Hacktoberfest is a way for us to raise awareness about open source software and
encourage more developers or technical writers to contribute to the space.

We welcome **both code and non-code contributions** , such as docs improvement,
tutorials, or blog posts.

There are three QuestDB projects accepting contributions:

1. [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb): QuestDB core database written
   in Java and C++.
2. [Documentation](https://github.com/questdb/questdb.io): QuestDB docs site
   built with Docusaurus.
3. [Web console](https://github.com/questdb/ui/tree/main/packages/web-console):
   QuestDB web console written in Typescript and React.
