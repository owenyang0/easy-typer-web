## Merry Questmas!

We wish you a year full of joy, peace, and prosperity. We will keep your
ingestion speedy and your query swift.

## What's coming for January 2023

In the meantime, look out for the QuestDB Santa's gifts:

- Parallel ingestion across all protocols via WAL
- Pandas integration
- New `UUID` data type

Explore the power of QuestDB by running the example queries on our [demo site](https://demo.questdb.io/), and
