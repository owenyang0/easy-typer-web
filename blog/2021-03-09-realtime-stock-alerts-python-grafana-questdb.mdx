This submission comes from one of our community contributors
[Kovid Rathee](https://kovidrathee.medium.com/) who has written a great guide
for setting up alerting via Grafana.

Thanks for your contribution, Kovid!

## Introduction

There are many reasons why reacting to time series data is useful, and the
quicker you can respond to changes in this data, the better. The best tool for
this job is easily a time series database, a type of database designed to write
and read large amounts of measurements that change over time.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to read data from a REST API and stream it
to QuestDB, an open-source time series database. We will use Grafana to
visualize the data and notify Slack of changes that interest us. We use Python
to fetch data from the API and stream it to QuestDB, and you can easily
customize the scripts to check different stocks or even APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the tutorial, you will need the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to run Grafana and
  QuestDB with Docker Compose
- [IexFinance account](https://iextrading.com/developers/), which offers a free
  tier for 50,000 API calls per month to poll stock prices
- [Slack workspace](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace)
  (optional)

The Python example in this tutorial uses
[real-time price for a stock](https://github.com/questdb/questdb-slack-grafana-alerts/blob/main/python/stock_data_TSLA_example.py#L29),
using the last trade on IEX. Prices outside of market hours can be retrieved
from the `extendedPrice` field from the Quote endpoint. For more information,
see the [IexCloud quote endpoint](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#quote)

This tutorial uses Slack as an example notification channel to deliver alerts
via Grafana, but it's simple to choose another channel you would like alerts
delivered to, such as your own REST API via webhook, Kafka, email, Pagerduty and
more. For more details on the available notification channels, see the Grafana
documentation for the
[list of supported notifiers](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/notifications/#list-of-supported-notifiers).

## Start QuestDB and Grafana

To clone the GitHub repository and start the example project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/questdb/questdb-slack-grafana-alerts.git
cd questdb-slack-grafana-alerts
docker-compose up
```

Running `docker-compose up` brings up two networked containers:

- Grafana on `http://localhost:3000`
- QuestDB on `http://localhost:9000` as well as a port open on `8812`, which
  accepts Postgres wire protocol

Running `docker-compose up` will also
[provision Grafana](https://github.com/bsmth/questdb-slack-grafana-alerts/tree/main/grafana)
with the default connection credentials to QuestDB for Postgres authentication.
By provisioning credentials, you can use QuestDB as a default data source in
Grafana right away without manual configuration steps.

Verify QuestDB and Grafana are running by visiting the URLs listed above or use
`docker-compose ps` from the repository root which will show you the running
containers:

```bash title="docker-compose ps"
     Name                   Command               State                            Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
grafana_alerts   /run.sh                          Up      0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
questdb_alerts   /app/bin/java --add-export ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8812->8812/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp, 9009/tcp
```

## Send data to QuestDB

The Python dependencies required for this tutorial are provided in the
`requirements.txt` file and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We will use the [IexFinance API](https://pypi.org/project/iexfinance/) to fetch
real-time stock prices, but first, we can verify the configuration is correct by
using a test script that generates dummy data. The mock script generates random
prices so that we don't deplete the API call limit during testing.

To start sending mock data to QuestDB, run the mock data script in the `python`
directory:

```bash
cd python
python mock_stock_data_example.py
```

The script will create a table `stock_prices`, and it will start sending mock
data to this table. The columns that we have are:

| column            | description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `stockListed`     | name of the stock, e.g., `TSLA` for Tesla             |
| `stockPrice`      | price of the stock in USD as `double`                 |
| `createdDateTime` | timestamp at which stockPrice was ingested in QuestDB |

One feature of QuestDB that we are using for the stock name is the `symbol` data
type optimized for text columns with repetitive values. More information on this
type can be found on the QuestDB
[documentation for symbol type](/docs/concept/symbol).

To verify if data is arriving in QuestDB:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000`
2. Run the following query:

```questdb-sql
SELECT * FROM stock_prices;
```

We should see all rows from our table returned at the bottom panel:

/>

## Query real-time stock prices

Once you have tested the ingestion using the mock data script, we can start
making requests to an API for live market data and query real-time stock prices.
To configure IexFinance API authentication:

1. On the [IexFinance console](https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens), create an
   API token
2. Click **Reveal Secret Token** and copy the value

<Screenshot

  height={285}
  src="/img/blog/2021-03-09/iex-finance-api.png"
  width={650}
/>

Now we can add this token to our project, so the Python scripts have
programmatic access to the IexFinance API. To store project secrets, we are
using the [Python dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) package,
which allows passing configuration to Python scripts as environment variables.
We can explicitly pass a token to each API call to IexFinance, or we can use the
`IEX_TOKEN` environment variable that the Python library will check implicitly.
To add the token:

1. Create a new file `./python/.env`
2. Paste the token in the `.env` file in the format `IEX_TOKEN=Skwf93hD...`
3. Run the live market data example:

```bash
cd python
python stock_data_TSLA_example.py
```

If the markets are open, real-time prices will be sent to QuestDB:

```log
Inserting rows into table 'stock_prices' - press Ctrl-C to stop
Inserting into 'stock_prices': TSLA 673.58 2021-03-10 12:37:23.147258
...
```

## Slack incoming webhook

The next step is to create an incoming webhook in Slack to send alerts as
HTTP(S) requests from Grafana. To set up the webhook:

1. Navigate to the
   [create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) page and
   create an app called **Price Alerts** for your workspace
2. Click **Incoming Webhooks** in the features section
3. Activate incoming webhooks and click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
4. Select the Slack channel you want to receive alerts in and click **Allow**
5. Copy the Webhook URL which is in the following format

```bash
https://hooks.slack.com/services/T123/B0123/2Fb...
```

## Grafana notification channels

The final step in connecting Slack and Grafana is to create a notification
channel. To configure a Slack notification channel to send alerts to:

1. Log in to Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` using the default credentials:

```txt
user:admin
pass:admin
```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/alerting/notifications and click **Add
   channel**
3. Give it the name **Stock Price Alert** and choose the `Slack` type
4. Paste the webhook URL in the **Url** field
5. In the **Notification settings** dropdown, enable the **Include image**
   checkbox
6. Click **Test** to verify that the configuration is correct and then click
   **Save**

Your Slack workspace should display a test notification coming from Grafana:

  width={450}
/>

## Grafana alerts

Next up, we can create a new panel on Grafana and configure alerts based on
queries we're interested in:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/new` and click **+ Add new panel**
2. In the **Query** panel, click the pencil icon or click **Edit SQL**
3. Paste the following example query

```questdb-sql
SELECT createdDatetime time,
       round(avg(stockPrice),2) avgPrice
FROM stock_prices
WHERE stock = 'TSLA'
SAMPLE BY 5s;
```

We now have a visualization of five-second averages of Tesla's stock price:

  src="/img/blog/2021-03-09/graphing-tsla-over-time.png"
  width={650}
/>

To make sure we don't lose our visualization panel, click **Save** and give the
dashboard a name of our choice.

### Rules and conditions

To understand how alerts work, let's take a brief look at the concepts. The two
main components for setting up alerts are the alert **Rule** and **Conditions**.

The **Rule** has the following settings:

- `Name` to give the alert a descriptive title
- `Evaluate every` is how often the scheduler will evaluate the alert rule
- `for` specifies how long the query needs to violate the thresholds before
  triggering alert notifications

The **Conditions** section has the following settings:

- `WHEN` sets an aggregate function on a series
- `OF` is the query to alert on over a time range in the format
  `query(query_name, from, until)`
- `IS ...` allows specifying a comparison to a value or range

For more information on the conditions of alerting, see the Grafana
[alert conditions documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/create-alerts/#conditions).

### Create an alert

The example alert we are using in this tutorial will be triggered if the minimum
value of the query named `5-second Avg. of TSLA` is below `762`, and we will set
the time range for alerting to the last thirty seconds. To set up this alert:

1. Edit the query and select the **Alert** tab
2. Click **Create Alert** and give it the name `Tesla Stock Price alert`
3. In the **Rule** section:
   - Set **Evaluate every** to `10 seconds`
   - Set **for** to `30 seconds`
4. In the **Conditions** section:
   - Set **WHEN** to `min()`
   - Set **OF** to `query(5-second Avg. of TSLA, 30s, now())`
   - Click **IS ABOVE**, change this to **IS BELOW**, and set the value to `762`
5. Use the default values in the **No Data & Error Handling** section
6. In **Notifications -> Send to**, choose the `Stock Price Alerts` notification
   channel
7. Add an optional message to be delivered with the alert

  src="/img/blog/2021-03-09/configuring-alert.png"
  width={650}
/>

When the conditions of the alert are met, we will see Slack notifications
arriving in the channel that we have configured:

## Summary

In this tutorial, we've shown how Grafana and QuestDB can be quite powerful for
data visualization and alerting. We learned how to ingest live ticker data from
a REST API into QuestDB and how to visualize this data in a Grafana dashboard
and set up alerts based on predefined conditions.

The next steps for improvements to the Python scripts could be command-line
arguments for multiple stock symbols, and better error handling if markets are
not open. Feel free to
