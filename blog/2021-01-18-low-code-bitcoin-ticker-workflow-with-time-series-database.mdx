We've had many predictions of the emerging trends of 2020. Three that ended up
ringing very true were the popularity of low-code platforms, the rise of
time-series databases, and a digital currency boom. This tutorial combines these
three topics into one example workflow automation that stores and analyzes
Bitcoin market prices in QuestDB with a workflow template to get up and running
quickly.

<!--truncate-->

## Prerequisites

This tutorial will use the docker images for both QuestDB and n8n.io so users
should ensure that they have the following installed and running on their
system:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Confirm that this is correctly set up by requesting the version number:

```shell
docker --version
Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61
```

## What is a low-code platform

low-code platforms allow for building applications without having to dig deep
into code or technical implementation details. Most of the tools in this
category use a visual editor and have drag-and-drop features to allow for
quickly building systems that would otherwise require more intensive development
resources. The main benefits are for users who either lack professional
programming experience or don't want to invest time building applications from
the ground up and manage rapidly-changing compatibility issues.

A great platform that I've been using recently is [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/),
which offers a creative and efficient visual editor for process automation. Over
200 integrations supported out-of-the-box means you have a lot to choose from if
you want to start streaming data into QuestDB from the supported nodes quickly.

This tutorial demonstrates how to use an n8n.io workflow that queries Bitcoin
market prices via a REST API and uses QuestDB as a data store for the market
prices as time series data.

## Setup steps

The first step will be to get n8n.io up and running using docker:

```shell
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

This command mounts a volume with `-v` so that user configurations will be saved
at `~/.n8n`. QuestDB can be started with the following docker command:

```
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8812:8812 --name questdb-n8n questdb/questdb
```

By giving the container a name with `--name questdb`, we have an easy way to
refer to the container created by `run` later on. If we want to re-use the same
container (and its data!) after it has been stopped, we can use the following
commands:

```shell
# bring the container up
docker start questdb-n8n
# shut the container down
docker stop questdb-n8n
```

## Import an example workflow

To get started with our example workflow, navigate to
`http://localhost:5678/`. In the left menu, click the
greater-than icon **>** to expand the menu and reveal a navigation panel. To
help us along with the setup steps, we have a template that can be imported
directly from a URL.

Select **Workflows** -> **import from URL** and paste the following URL:

```bash
https://questdb-docs.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/QuestDB_BTC_Ticker.json
```

If imported successfully, the workflow will be generated automatically in the
editor window:

  title="Example QuestDB BTC ticker workflow imported from URL"
  width={650}
/>

Each of the nodes with their configuration can be inspected at any time by
double-clicking and inspecting the **Parameters** and **Settings** panel. From
left-to-right we have the following objects:

- **QuestDB** node which executes an SQL statement to create our `btc` table
- **cron** node which is set to a 1 minute interval
- **HTTP Request** node which makes a `GET` request to a public API with latest
  BTC value in USD
- **Set** node which selects the fields we are interested in from the HTTP
  response and assigns them the correct type
- **QuestDB** node which inserts incoming values from the Set node into a `btc`
  table

## Connecting to QuestDB

Before we activate the workflow, we have to provide connection credentials to
QuestDB. In the left navigation menu, select **Credentials** -> **New** and
choose type **QuestDB**.

The default configuration provides most of the information we need for a QuestDB
instances running locally, but we will need to allow the QuestDB node access to
these credentials in the **Nodes with access** section.

When correctly set up, the credentials configuration should look like the
following:

/>

## Activating the workflow

To check if the workflow is correctly configured, click the **Execute Node**
button on the first QuestDB node. On success, we should have a new table `btc`
with a `Timestamp` and `price` column. Activating the workflow with the toggle
in the top-right of the workflow editor will prompt you to save the workflow if
you have not done so already. Give the workflow the name `QuestDB BTC Ticker`
and click **Save**. If everything is set up correctly, we will have a success
indicator on each of the nodes which are passing as expected and a notification
window will display the status of the workflow:

  title="The active workflow writing data to QuestDB"
  width={650}
/>

We can confirm that we are writing data to QuestDB by navigating to
`http://localhost:9000/`. The `btc` table is visible in
the top-left **Tables** panel and we can query incoming requests by simply
adding `btc` to the query editor and selecting **Run**. The data will be
returned as a table by default, but can easily be graphed by selecting the
**Chart** button and specifying `price` as the series to visualize:

  title="Graphing our ticker data in QuestDB"
  width={650}
/>

We can create some aggregate queries if we require specific data points or
charts. The following SQL query allows for 5 minute aggregates of our incoming
BTC pricing data:

```
SELECT count() as entries, Timestamp, avg(price)
FROM (btc timestamp(Timestamp))
SAMPLE BY 5m;
```

## Next steps

In this article, we've covered how to get started with n8n.io, a low-code
workflow automation platform to query a public REST API, stream data into
QuestDB, and build some simple data visualizations with QuestDB's built-in
charting functionality. Our example uses minimal information we need from the
REST API, so future changes could be to have more fields or currencies being
inserted into QuestDB to make more interesting comparisons across multiple
tables. We are also using the **cron** node with an interval of 1 minute, so
improvements would be to use a node that can provide much higher rates of
ingestion to leverage the performance benefits of QuestDB.

For inspiration and troubleshooting workflow automations using n8n, take a look
