Learn about our latest release with dynamic commits, a new case study with
Prediko, updates about our Cloud offering, and community news.

### QuestDB 6.6.1

We just released 6.6.1!

In this upgrade, we deliver dynamic commits: developers no longer have to tinker
with commit lag configuration. Data ingestion performance and availability of
data for reads are both optimized dynamically.

[QuestDB 6.6.1](/blog/2022/11/25/questdb-6.6.1-dynamic-commits/)

This release also contains some pull requests from our community. Kudos to
[@sreenath-tm](https://github.com/sreenath-tm),
[@klurpicolo](https://github.com/klurpicolo), and
[@vgrichina](https://github.com/vgrichina) for the code contributions!

### Prediko case study

Prediko uses QuestDB to provide fast analytics and forecasts to its e-commerce
customers.

### Tutorial: `SAMPLE BY` deep dive

`SAMPLE BY` is a SQL extension in QuestDB that helps you group or bucket
time-series data. Our champion contributor, Kovid Rathee, published a new and
in-depth tutorial on `SAMPLE BY`.

### Community news

- One of our core engineers, [Jaromir Hamala](https://twitter.com/jerrinot) ,
  wrote [an article](/blog/2022/11/30/full-table-scan-are-fast/) about the power
  of full table scanning and why indices may not always be necessary to achieve
  fast reads. Then, Jaromir caught a cold, and rapped about QuestDB in bed

- Our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/questdb/projects/1/views/5)
  is updated - exciting items lined up include WAL-based ingestion, ingestion of
  Pandas dataframes via ILP, role-based authorization, UUID data type, access to
  QuestDB logs in Cloud, and a connector for Apache Flink!

- Shout-out to our community members who continue to show their support; thank
  you to [@vgrichina](https://twitter.com/vgrichina/status/1592741182022770691)
