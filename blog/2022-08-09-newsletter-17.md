Learn about our latest 6.5 release, a case study with the largest retailer in
Aisa, new ILP clients for different programming languages, and news from our
community.

### QuestDB 6.5

This release brings **a new algorithm** for SQL `COPY`, which is specifically
designed to enable **fast and easy CSV import for large and unsorted data
files**.Â This feature comes in handy when you want to migrate a large amount of
data from other databases to QuestDB. Learn more about the feature:

[CSV import](/docs/guides/importing-data/)

In addition, there are several improvements and fixes for the Influx line
protocol, Core, and SQL engine, which are includedÂ in the
[full release notes](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/6.5).
