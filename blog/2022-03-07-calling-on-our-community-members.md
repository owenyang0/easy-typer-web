There is a lot of Ukraine in QuestDB: Our co-founder Vlad and two of our
engineers, Alex and Eugene, are both Ukrainians. This is our response
and our call on all our users to join us in helping the people of
Ukraine.

<!--truncate-->

Eugene was working from his home in Kyiv - the war now forced him and his family
to hide in a bunker. Last Thursday he managed to join our daily standup call in
between bombardments and we were glad to see him alive and well. Our collective
prayers go to him and his family.

We deplore the situation and are focussed on supporting our employees. With the
help of other communities we are evaluating the best options for our employees
and their families, offering logistical support and providing the latest
security updates.

We also call on all our users to join us in helping the people of Ukraine -
together, we can make an impact.

- The following [website](https://supportukrainenow.org/) is a source of
  information to help people in need through donations and other means.
- A fellow Y Combinator founder is in Moldova and Romania to help on the ground
  and is currently raising
  [funds](https://fundly.com/support-my-relatives-and-friends-in-ukraine).

We thank all our stakeholders, users and community members for your support
during these challenging times.

We hope that peace gets restored in the region quickly.
