### QuestDB 6.5.5

Since our last issue, we have had two releases: 6.5.4 and 6.5.5.

Thanks to **Hacktoberfest 2022**, we dedicated
[version 6.5.4](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/6.5.4) to our
contributors, who have added several new SQL numeric and string functions to
QuestDB.

In [version 6.5.5](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/6.5.5), we
added support for ISO week and improved the migration experience when importing
CSV files exported from PostgreSQL or similar databases.

### QuestDB Kafka Connector

We have just released the official QuestDB Connector for Apache Kafka! The
connector reads data from Kafka topics and writes data to QuestDB tables.

If you are using both Kafka and QuestDB, you can
[get started here](/docs/third-party-tools/kafka/questdb-kafka/).

### QuestDB Python Client 1.0.2

We released a new patch for the QuestDB Python client library to support
**Python 3.11**.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client)
- [Documentation](https://py-questdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/questdb/)

### Tutorial: Data lifecycle with QuestDB

For mostÂ time-series data applications, the value of each data point diminishes
over time. Our contributor, [Yitaek Hwang](https://yitaek.medium.com/), explains
how you can downsample data and detach or drop partitions when old data is no
longer necessary in QuestDB.

### QuestDB at Open Source Spotlight

Open Source Spotlight is a Youtube series for developers to present and demo
