May 2022 brings **QuestDB 6.3**, a release focused on _performance and usability_ based on the vital feedback of our
[user community](https://slack.questdb.io/) and [customers](https://questdb.io/customers/). Here's a roundup of changes
that have just landed in the latest, greatest version yet.

## Multi-threaded SQL execution for filter queries

We have parallelized and achieved significant performance gains in SQL statements that contain a `where` clause with 
simple arithmetic expressions, and for queries that make use of `limit` with both positive and negative offsets. This 
is thanks to the improved [JIT sub-system](https://questdb.io/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/), which is now always 
switched on by default, and through extensive use of our in-house [async bus](https://questdb.io/blog/2021/11/03/interthread).

[Enter the Demo Box](https://demo.questdb.io/) and experience how **1.63 x 10<sup>9</sup>** rows are blazed through in 
milliseconds:

## Filesystem snapshot support for cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)

We have optimised query cache retention for all ingestion methods (Http, ILP, PGWire), along with providing support for 
database backups via filesystem snapshots. Combined, these enable live database backups to be inexpensive in terms of 
impact on ongoing ingestion, SQL execution performance, and cloud costs.

You can now backup your database live via cloud-native filesystem snapshots in three steps:

1. Issue statement `SNAPSHOT PREPARE`, which locks all table readers and flushes filesystem caches to disk (through 
   the sync syscall). 
2. Invoke the cloud-specific snapshot procedure and leave it running for however long it needs.
3. Issue statement `SNAPSHOT COMPLETE` to release the readers. You do **not have to wait** for #2 to complete. 

This feature can be disabled by setting `cairo.snapshot.recovery.enabled` to false.

## Performance optimisation for LATEST ON syntax

We have optimised the execution of `LATEST ON` statements over un-indexed symbol columns to achieve two orders of 
magnitude performance gains **without the need for indexes**. The following SQL creates a sample table containing 
500_000 rows and then finds the latest sentiment per fiat currency: 

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE sample_table AS (
    SELECT 
        rnd_symbol('Dollar', 'Euro', 'Hryvnia', 'Yuan') fiat,
        rnd_int(1, 1000, 0) sentiment,
        timestamp_sequence(0, 3600000000L) ts 
    FROM long_sequence(500000)
) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY MONTH;

SELECT * FROM sample_table 
WHERE fiat in ('Dollar', 'Euro', 'Hryvnia', 'Yuan') 
LATEST ON ts partition by fiat;
```

## Read-only mode for PGWire protocol

You can now make connections to QuestDB over the PGWire protocol in read-only mode by setting ``pg.security.readonly`` 
to true in `server.conf`. Attempts to create, drop, truncate and alter tables, as well as to insert data will result in 
exception **org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: Write permission denied**. 

## SQL syntax formatting and table name autocomplete in web console

The web console auto-completes table names:

and allows you to format SQL statements by means of options `Format Document` and `Format Selection`, available in the 
context menu of the SQL editor (right click):
