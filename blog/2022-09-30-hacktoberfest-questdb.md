## Hacktoberfest

For those who aren't familiar with Hacktoberfest, it's a month-long online
celebration for open-source softwares and communities. The first 40,000
participants who
[successfully completed the requirements](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors)
will be rewarded with a special-edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt üëï or a tree
planted in your name. üå¥

Participating in Hacktoberfest is one of our approaches to raise awareness and
encourage more developers or technical writers to contribute to open source. We
welcome both code and non-code contributions, such as docs improvement,
tutorials, and blog posts.

## ‚õ≥ About us

[QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) is a high-performance open-source
database for time series. The project is built from scratch in Java and C++ with
no dependencies and zero garbage collection. It is optimized for high-throughput
ingestion over InfluxDB line protocol and fast SQL queries. QuestDB is also one
of the most popular time series databases according to the independent reviewer
[DBEngines](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/time+series+dbms).

Developers can use QuestDB as a library for java applications.
[Official clients](/docs/reference/clients/overview/) for
[Python](https://github.com/questdb/py-questdb-client),
[Go](https://github.com/questdb/go-questdb-client),
[C, C++, Rust](https://github.com/questdb/c-questdb-client),
[Node.js](https://github.com/questdb/nodejs-questdb-client) and
[.NET](https://github.com/questdb/net-questdb-client) are also available for the
wider developer community.

This year, there are three QuestDB open source projects opted in for
Hacktoberfest:

1. [**QuestDB**](https://github.com/questdb/questdb): QuestDB core database,
   mainly written in Java and C++. Check
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   to get started.
2. [**Documentation**](https://github.com/questdb/questdb.io): QuestDB's website
   for documentation, suitable for technical writers who have experience with
   Markdown and Docusaurus. Read
   [our guidelines for docs contributors](https://github.com/questdb/questdb.io#contributing).
3. [**Web console**](https://github.com/questdb/ui/tree/main/packages/web-console):
   Monorepo that contains the code of QuestDB GUI. It is a web application
   written with Typescript and React.

## üöÄ Contribute to QuestDB

If you're interested in contributing to QuestDB, make sure you read the official
guidelines about
[contributors](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors),
[pull requests](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details), and
[spam](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam).

To keep a friendly environment for both maintainers and contributors, we put
together extra recommendations to increase the chance that your pull requests
get merged:

- Pay attention to `CONTRIBUTING.md` or any contribution guidelines available.
- Start with existing issues rather than creating new ones. While new ideas are
  generally welcomed, they don't always fit the project roadmap.
- Filter issues with `good first issues` or `help wanted` tags if you're new to
  the projects.
- Avoid commenting on all the available issues but those you really plan to work
  on, to leave some opportunities to other contributors.
- Our maintainers will review your pull requests, please make sure you address
  all the comments before asking for another review.

## üéÅ QuestDB swag

In addition to the official reward, if you successfully contribute one valid
pull-request to any of the QuestDB projects listed above, we offer an extra
QuestDB T-shirt for you through our [swag program](/community/). üöÄ
