## 6.2.1 Release

This month we released **QuestDB 6.2.1**! This version focuses mainly on
usability and stability improvements. Here's the highlights of new features that
landed in the latest release:

- Multi-queue support to accelerate multiple table ingestion in ILP
- ILP configuration to disconnect on errors to prevent data loss
- New table writer metrics in the Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Flag to report JIT compilation status in REST API
- Icon in the web console that indicates JIT-enabled query execution
- Optimized query performance for `ORDER BY` designated timestamp with filters
- Improved `DROP TABLE` syntax to use with `IF EXISTS`
