Learn about our latest releases, a case study with Copenhagen Atomics, our
public engineering roadmap, and news from our community.

### New features since QuestDB 6.5

This release adds new SQL statements `ALTER TABLE DETACH`/`ATTACH PARTITION` for
detaching and re-attaching partitions to tables, providing a solution to
manually offload data to cold storage. Special thanks to
[@glasstiger](https://github.com/glasstiger) and
[@Zahlii](https://github.com/Zahlii) for contributing to our GitHub repos!

[DETACH partition](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-detach-partition/)

### Copenhagen Atomics case study

We published a new case study together with Copenhagen Atomics!

Copenhagen Atomics is a manufacturer of next generation molten salt reactors to
deliver abundant energy with a waste profile 100x lower than traditional
nuclear. They use QuestDB to monitor the reactors' temperature, liquid flows and
pressure in real time.
