Monthly updates from the QuestDB team with a deep dive into QuestDB 6.4,
Redpanda integration, MindsDB joint-webinar, community updates, and more.

## QuestDB 6.4

We just shipped QuestDB 6.4! This version includes the long-awaited **SQL
UPDATE** statement ([docs](/docs/reference/sql/update/)), which allows users to
modify already-written records in QuestDB.

```questdb-sql title="Update with constant"
UPDATE trades SET price = 125.34 WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';
```

```questdb-sql title="Update with function"
UPDATE book SET mid = (bid + ask)/2 WHERE symbol = 'AAPL';
```

Here is a blog post that explains why `UPDATE` matters for time-series
databases: [QuestDB 6.4](/blog/2022/05/31/questdb-release-6-4/)

## Query benchmark vs Clickhouse and Timescale

Our engineering team just published a new benchmarking article, in which we
compare QuestDB with other time-series databases and publish the results. This
benchmark comes on the back of QuestDB's
[new JIT (Just-in-Time) compiler](/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/) and
[multi-threaded execution for filter queries](/blog/2022/05/09/questdb-release-6-3/).

With this performance, scanning through billions of records without the need of
building indexes becomes a reality.

### Integration with Redpanda

A new tutorial is published by our contributor,
[Yitaek Hwang](https://yitaek.medium.com/), together with the Redpanda team.

**Redpanda** is an open-source, Kafka-compatible streaming platform that uses
C++ and Raft to replace Java and Zookeeper. You will learn how to build a
real-time crypto tracker using QuestDB and Redpanda.
