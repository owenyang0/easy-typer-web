We've just published 6.1.3 and it includes Prometheus Alertmanager support, new
counters in the Prometheus endpoint for memory info, automatic query timeout,
Monaco as the new SQL editor for QuestDB's web interface, and more UI additions.
Here's a roundup of changes that have just landed in the latest and greatest
version!

## Monaco Editor from VS Code in QuestDB UI

The SQL editor in QuestDB's web console now includes the
[Monaco Editor that powers VS Code](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/).
Upgrading the SQL editor to use the Monaco Editor brings with it many
improvements and functionality that comes by default with VS Code, so now you
get convenient features like bracket matching, find and replace-all, multiple
cursor selection, and more right out of the box:

For more information on using the Monaco Editor in QuestDB, type <kbd>F1</kbd>
in QuestDB's web console, or refer to the official
[Monaco documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics).

## Prometheus metrics

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit which
collects and stores metrics as time series data. Prometheus collects small
pieces of data about many components to help build a picture of the state and
trajectory of a system. The scraped metrics are stored, and rules can be applied
to aggregate and generate new metrics from existing data or generate alerts
based on user-defined triggers.

QuestDB has a `/metrics` HTTP endpoint on port `9003` which provide counters in
Prometheus format. Prometheus can be used to visualize and graph QuestDB metrics
prefixed with `questdb_`:

For more information on configuring QuestDB and Prometheus to graph QuestDB
metrics, see the [Prometheus documentation](/docs/third-party-tools/prometheus)
for examples and hints for setup and configuration.

## Prometheus Alertmanager

Release 6.1.3 introduces a new log writer for QuestDB that sends any message to
Prometheus
[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/). To
configure this writer, add it to the `writers` config alongside other log
writers. Details on logging configuration can be found on the
[server configuration documentation](/docs/reference/configuration#configuration-file).

Configuring that QuestDB should send alerts to Alertmanager alerting is done in
QuestDB's log config with the address and port for Alertmanager:

```ini title="./conf/log.conf"
# Which writers to enable
writers=stdout,alert

# Prometheus Alertmanager
w.alert.class=io.questdb.log.LogAlertSocketWriter
w.alert.level=CRITICAL
w.alert.alertTargets=172.17.0.2:9093
```

For details on configuring QuestDB to send alerts to Alertmanager, see the
[Prometheus documentation](/docs/third-party-tools/prometheus) for examples and
guides for setup and configuration.

## SQL syntax for bulk inserts

It's now possible to bulk insert vales into a table via SQL. This functionality
follows the 'multirow' `VALUES` syntax used in PostgreSQL and acts as an
accelerator when inserting data in bulk:

```questdb-sql
CREATE TABLE my_table(id SYMBOL index, val DOUBLE,ts TIMESTAMP)
  timestamp(ts);

INSERT INTO my_table
VALUES
    ('d1', 101.1, '2021-10-05T11:31:35.878Z'),
    ('d1', 101.2, '2021-10-05T12:31:35.878Z'),
    ('d2', 201.2, '2021-10-05T12:31:35.878Z'),
    ('d2', 201.3, '2021-10-05T13:31:35.878Z'),
    ('d2', 201.4, '2021-10-05T14:31:35.878Z');
```

## Automatic SQL query timeout

Users can now define automatic timeouts for SQL queries via server
configuration. This is set using the `query.timeout.sec` server configuration
and is a global timeout in seconds used for long-running queries. For more
information on setting this parameter, see the
[server configuration documentation](/docs/reference/configuration).

```ini title="/path/to/server.conf"
# Default is 60 sec
query.timeout.sec=60
```

## Next up

The team will be adding Java 17 support in the next release, meanwhile, we're
working on `UPDATE`/`DELETE` support, a JIT (Just-in-time) compiler for filters,
and more stability improvements on InfluxDB line protocol.

We hope you enjoyed the features and functionality in version 6.1.3. See the
