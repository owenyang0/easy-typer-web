## About Devoxx

Belgium is one of the Devoxx events where community members explore the latest
technology advancements with some of the most inspiring speakers in the tech
sector. Diverse, local, and global talent introduce the newest and most vital

## QuestDB at Devoxx

As a member of the Java community, QuestDB sponsored this year's Devoxx Belgium
as a Silver partner, together with open-source databases such as Neo4j, Redis,
MongoDB, and many other tech companies.

We wanted to make the most of meeting the community, and we thought nearly a
fifth of our company should be enough, but the attendees were eager to learn
more about QuestDB and we wished we had more people!

Our ability to ingest over 1.5 million records per second caught a lot of
attention and people were interested to learn the fact that we are a fully open
source, Apache 2.0 licensed project: participants appreciated the opportunity to
see the source code and use it in any way they see fit. They were also excited
about our managed cloud offering. All in all, we spoke to over 100 attendees
from every type of company and use case: public sector organizations, financial
industry, industrial IoT companies, fleet tracking, energy providers, telcos,
and of course some geeks thinking of using QuestDB for their personal projects.

In addition, attendees could get their hands dirty and run interactive queries
on our demo datasets, so techies experienced firsthand the flexibility and
performance of QuestDB. For us, it was essential to learn about different
community use cases, understand users' pain points, and investigate ways to make
QuestDB even more relevant for users.

## Vlad's talk

Our CTO, Vlad, delivered a talk entitled "Database Hacking 101: Building fast
bulk import in Java + C". The talk is part of the Server Side Java track, which
covers presentations about server-side frameworks and libraries.

Vlad showcased how the [CSV import](/docs/guides/importing-data/) speed is
improved thanks to [`io_uring`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring).
