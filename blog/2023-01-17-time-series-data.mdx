This blog post covers the basics of time-series data and its most common use
cases and applications. We introduce the time-series database category, which has
seen an explosion in popularity since a decade ago.

Additionally, we will cover the design and trade-offs for a time-series database
and show how SQL can deal with time-series data workloads, using QuestDB's ANSI SQL syntax as an example.

## Time-series data explained

Time-series is a succession of data points ordered by time. Time-series data is
often plotted on a chart where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is a metric
that changes over time. For example, stock prices change every microsecond or
even nanosecond, and the trend is best presented as time-series data.

Time-series data has always been plentiful in financial services with
fast-changing tick price data and in e-commerce/ad-tech to better understand
user analytics. With the rise in connected devices, application monitoring, and
observability, time-series data is now critical in nearly all fields. We list a
couple of examples below:

Time-series data has several unique characteristics:

- The amount of data created and processed is large.
- The amount of data flowing from the source is often uninterrupted.
- The volume is also unpredictable and can come with bursts of high volumes of
  data incoming at irregular intervals. This is very common in financial
  markets, with spikes of trading volume occurring after events, which are
  difficult to predict.
- Fresh data needs to be analyzed on the fly. Anomaly detection is a good
  example.

With the rise of time-series data, time series has been the fastest-growing
database category for the past five years according to
[DB-engines](https://db-engines.com/de/ranking/time+series+dbms).

## The design of a time-series database

As use cases and the need for time series analysis are increasing exponentially, so is the amount of raw data itself. To
better cope with the ever-growing amount of data, time-series databases emerged a decade ago. They focus on performance
with fast ingests to process a higher number of data points. The trade-off is less stringent consistency guarantees,
which are typically must-haves for OLTP workloads. 

It is pretty common for time-series databases not to be ACID compliant. Unlike traditional databases in which older data
entries are typically updated with the most recent data point to show the latest state, time-series databases
continuously accumulate data points over time. This way, one can draw insights from the evolution of metrics to conclude
meaningful insights from the data. 

This is why TSDBs are optimized for write operations rather than updates. Once the data is stored in a database, most
use cases require querying this data in real-time to uncover insights on the data quickly. DevOps teams will set
real-time alerts to detect anomalies in server metrics such as CPU or memory. E-commerce websites need to understand
buyers' behavior to gather new insights and optimize their stock. A fintech company will want to detect fraud as
transactions occur.

## Most important features and trade-offs for a time-series database

Time-series databases are not optimized for OLTP workloads that typically include lots of regular update and delete
operations. Those are better handled by relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. In contrast, time-series data
is mostly an append-only workload with delete operations performed in batches on less recent data. With time-series, we
are concerned the most about the recent data coming in that is being analyzed on the fly. 

To better cater to these needs, time-series databases pack a set of features that makes them stand out from relational
databases and other types. We provide a list of these must-have features for a TSDB. Then, we show how you can do this
on QuestDB, an open-source time-series database with fast ingests and SQL queries. You can run the examples on the
QuestDB demo site to check the query performance.

- **Automated partitioning management**

  Time partitions are created automatically as data arrives. In QuestDB, data is
  partitioned by time (hourly, daily, weekly or monthly).
  [Slicing the data by time partitions](/docs/concept/partitions/) makes
  time-based queries more efficient. Time-based queries will only lift the
  relevant time partitions from the disk rather than lifting the entire dataset.
  Partitioning also allows having multiple tiers of storage, where older
  partitions can be mounted into cold storage, which is cheaper and slower.

- **Downsampling and interpolation**

  Representing the data with a lower frequency. For example, shifting from a
  daily view to a monthly view. In order to facilitate such queries with SQL and
  make them less verbose, QuestDB built a native extension to ANSI SQL with the
  keyword [`SAMPLE BY`](/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/). This SQL statement
  slices the dataset by a time interval (15 minutes in our example below) and
  runs aggregations for that time period. We can optionally fill values for
  those periods for which we have no results (interpolation, fill with null,
  default, etc.)

  ```questdb-sql title="Running the VWAP of Bitcoin for every 15 minutes interval in the past day"
  SELECT
      timestamp,
      sum(price * amount) / sum(amount) AS vwap_price,
      sum(amount) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())
  SAMPLE BY 15m ALIGN TO CALENDAR;
  ```

- **Interval search**

  Fast retrieving data over arbitrary intervals. For example, zooming into a
  specific timeframe preceding a monitoring alert to better understand the
  underlying cause in real-time. QuestDB’s
  [`WHERE` filter](/docs/reference/sql/where/#symbol-and-string) and
  [`IN` time modifier](/docs/reference/sql/where/#time-range) for timestamp
  search is fast and efficient. The SQL query below retrieves all the data
  points in June 2018 for the column `pickup_datetime`:

  ```questdb-sql title="Retrieving data from the table ‘trips’, where the column ‘pickup_datatime’ happens during the month of June 2018"
  SELECT * FROM 'trips'
  WHERE pickup_datetime IN '2018-06';
  ```

- **Time series joins**

  Align join time-series data from two different tables, which do not have
  exactly matching timestamps. These are known as `ASOF` joins, which we have
  elaborated in the [ASOF JOIN section](/docs/reference/sql/join/#asof-join) in
  our documentation. Below, the two tables, `trips` and `weather`, each show
  values for given timestamps. However, the timestamps for each table are not
  equal. For each timestamp in `trips`, `ASOF` finds the nearest timestamp in
  `weather` and shows the associated weather value in the result table:

  ```questdb-sql title="Example of ASOF JOIN query between the tables ‘trips’ and ‘weather’ which have non-identical matching timestamps"
  SELECT pickup_datetime, fare_amount, tempF, windDir
  FROM (trips WHERE pickup_datetime IN '2018-06-01')
  ASOF JOIN weather;
  ```

- **Most recent first**

  With time-series data, the most recent data is often more likely to be
  analyzed. QuestDB’s SQL language extension includes
  [`LATEST ON`](/docs/reference/sql/latest-on/) to get the most recent view of a
  record instantly. As data is ingested in chronological order, QuestDB starts
  scanning from the bottom and can thus retrieve the data point fast.

  ```questdb-sql title="Retrieving the most recent data points for BTC-USD and ETH-USD prices with LATEST ON."
  SELECT * FROM trades
  WHERE symbol in ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')
  LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol;
  ```

- **Streaming ingestion protocols**

  As time-series data is mostly machine data, it is produced and streamed to a
  database in a continuous fashion. The ability to sustain streamed data rather
  than in slow batches quickly becomes a must. The
  [InfluxDB line protocol](/blog/2020/07/22/influxdb-lp-on-tcp/) is very
  efficient and offers a lot of flexibility. For example, you can create new
  columns on the fly without specifying a schema ahead of time.
