This month, we announce QuestDB 6.3 andÂ exciting partnerships with Cube.js and
MindsDB.

### QuestDB 6.3

We just released version 6.3! Here are highlights of the release:

- Introduce **new execution algorithms** for the `WHERE` clause predicates with
  ridiculousÂ performance gains.
- AddÂ cloud-native **filesystem snapshots** forÂ live database backups.
- Introduce **new `LATEST ON` algorithm** with over 100x performance bump.
- Introduce **read-only mode** for PostgreSQL wire protocol.
- Add new functionality to **formatÂ SQL queries** in the web console.
- ImproveÂ syntax highlighting by adding **autocomplete table names** in the web
  console.

Please note that we've left out `UPDATE` in this release because this feature
still requires more testing.

have a complete overview of all the newÂ features, improvements, and bug fixes in
this version.

### Integration with Cube.js

You can now use QuestDB with [Cube.js](https://cube.dev/), a headless business
intelligence platform that allows you to organize all the data into a structured
data model.

While QuestDB is optimized for slicing and dicing time-stamped data through its
[SQL extensions](/docs/concept/sql-extensions/),Â Cube offers multiple ways of
[pre-aggregating](https://cube.dev/docs/caching/using-pre-aggregations) data
effectively by building a caching layer on top of your data to speed up the
query performance. Together, QuestDB and Cube have your time series data all set
up for use downstream.

[blog post](/blog/2022/04/26/time-series-data-analytics-with-questdb-and-cube/)
to learn more.

### Integration with MindsDB

You can now perform time series forecasting in QuestDB with the new MindsDB
integration!

MindsDB acts as a prediction layer on top of QuestDB. You can pre-process your
time series data inside QuestDB and then access these data from MindsDB in
[SQL](https://docs.mindsdb.com/sql/) to produce powerful ML models.
