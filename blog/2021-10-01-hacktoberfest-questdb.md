Hacktoberfest 2021 is starting today! For the first time, QuestDB is
participating as an open source project. We're super excited to meet with other
open source contributors and maintainers.

For those who're not familiar with Hacktoberfest, it's a month-long online
celebration for open source software and communities. By
[contributing to open source projects](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation),
you can get a special edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt üëï or choose to plant a tree
for our planet. üå¥

Many widely used open-source projects are maintained by a small number of
developers or even a single person without any financial incentives. And we rely
so much on their perseverance and commitment! Participating in Hacktoberfest is
one of our approaches to raise awareness and encourage more people to contribute
to open source. To celebrate Hacktoberfest, we put together some hints for you
to get started.

1. Sign up for the event at
