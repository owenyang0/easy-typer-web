:::note

The UDP receiver is deprecated since QuestDB version 6.5.2.
We recommend the [TCP receiver](/docs/reference/api/ilp/tcp-receiver/) introduced by this article.

:::

We've had a UDP version of the InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) reader in QuestDB
for quite some time, but we've had customers ask for a TCP version of it, so we
delivered!

Using and configuring it are relatively simple, so this tutorial will walk you
through the basics of setting it up and using it. For an added bonus, we'll see
how to migrate from using InfluxDB to using QuestDB with a single-line
configuration change.

<!--truncate -->

## Configuring TCP InfluxDB line protocol listener

Here's the best part, at least for a basic implementation that you don't need to
performance tune at all: It's already set up.

That's right, as soon as you start QuestDB, both the UDP and TCP ILP listeners
start automatically on port `9009`. Yes, TCP and UDP both use the same port. No,
that's not a problem since one is UDP and one is TCP.

There are many configuration options you can tune in your `conf/server.conf`
file if you're interested. I won't go through them here, but you can read all
about them in our [docs](/docs/reference/api/ilp/overview). I hope they are
relatively self-explanatory.

## InfluxDB line protocol refresher

If you have used ILP before, this should all be review. If you're new to ILP,
this will tell you how you should write your data to QuestDB.

### Basic structure

```shell title="ILP syntax"
table_name,tagset valueset timestamp
```

Pretty basic. So let's dive into what each element actually is and how to
structure a line of ILP for writing.

The first element is the `table_name` portion, which tells the ILP writer which
database table to write values into.

Next comes the set of tags you want to use. These are standard `key=value`
pairs, and you can add as many of them as you want or need. Just separate them
with commas.

There should only ever be 2 spaces in your line protocol. No more. The first
space separates your `tags` from the `values` you want to associate with those
`tags`s. The second space separates the values from the timestamp for those tags
and values.

The values are also `key=value` pairs, and again you can send as many as you
want in a line.

Finally comes your `timestamp` value, typically in ÂµSeconds.

### Example ILP

Let's use an example of writing some environmental data to QuestDB. I have a
sensor that reads the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and altitude.

| Reading     | Value       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Temperature | 23.180000   |
| Humidity    | 51.982422   |
| Pressure    | 1002.112061 |
| Altitude    | 93.146370   |

And I want to use the following `tag`s:

| Tag Name | Tag Value |
| -------- | --------- |
| dev_id   | THP002    |
| dev_loc  | Apex      |
| dev_name | BME280    |

And my `table_name` is `iot`

Now I have all the basic elements I need to construct my ILP, which will look
like this:

`iot,dev_id=THP002,dev_loc=Apex,dev_name=BME280 temp_c=23.18,altitude=93.10,humidity=52.16,pressure=1002.12`

And yes, I rounded those values. But you'll notice that I did not add a
`timestamp` value. In this case, it's because I am sending the values from a
small, embedded sensor device that really doesn't have a great sense of time. By
sending the ILP without a `timestamp` I'm telling the database itself to add one
for me, using the `timestamp`s arrival time.

## Database structure

One of the cool features of using the ILP reader (well, QuestDB in general,
really) is the ability to do 'Schema on Write'.

What that means is that if an ILP message arrives, QuestDB will automatically
create tables and columns to fit the incoming ILP. So if you need to add a `tag`
later, you can add it to the new device's tagset and start writing. The new tag
will get added to the schema.

If you leave a tag value off, and it exists in the database, it will fill a
`null` value.

When I start writing the above ILP to QuestDB, I'll get a table that looks like
this:

| dev_id | dev_name | temp_c | humidity | timestamp                   | dev_loc | altitude | pressure |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.52  | 51.94    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.156202Z | Apex    | 76.27    | 1004.12  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.54  | 51.85    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.157358Z | Apex    | 75.97    | 1004.16  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.56  | 51.83    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.157389Z | Apex    | 75.84    | 1004.17  |
| THP002 | BME280   | 26.58  | 51.79    | 2020-07-21T14:54:59.287416Z | Apex    | 75.93    | 1004.16  |

This is what that table looks like in the QuestDB Web Console:

## But how did you write that?

Oh, so how did I write that ILP to QuestDB? Well, my sensor is an Arduino, with
a Bosch BME280 sensor attached. It is WiFi connected, so a `WiFiClient` can do
the TCP write for me:

```C title="WiFiClient Connect"
espClient.connect(Quest_Server, 9009);
```

Will connect the client to the QuestDB Server defined by `Quest_Server` on port
`9009`.

If I then have a line of ILP like this:
`iot,dev_id=THPL002,dev_loc=Demo,dev_name=BME280 temp_c=23.18,altitude=93.10,humidity=52.16,pressure=1002.12\n`
in a `buffer` I can call `espClient.printf(buffer);` and that line of data will
be written to QuestDB.

## Can I do batch writes?

Of course, you can! Put each line of ILP on a separate 'line', separated by a
newline `\n`, and then when you have all your batch built up, write the whole
thing to QuestDB.

Of course, if you're relying on QuestDB to add `timestamps` for you, then be
aware that QuestDB will give the entire batch sequential timestamps based on
when they are read/written to the database.

## Conclusions

InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) is a simple, well-known, and relatively compact
data format for sending Time Series data to a database. That's why we decided to
support it.

I'm now going to give you a simple configuration change to migrate from using
InfluxDB to using QuestDB. If you're using Telegraf as a data collector, we have
[documentation for integrating with QuestDB](/docs/third-party-tools/telegraf)
for more details, but to summarize the migration, edit `telegraf.conf` (it may
be in different places, depending on your operating system) and change the line:

```shell
[[outputs.influxdb]]
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:8086"]
```

to be:

```shell
[[outputs.socket_writer]]
  address = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9009"
```

That's it. That's the migration. All data that was previously being written to
InfluxDB will now be written to QuestDB.
