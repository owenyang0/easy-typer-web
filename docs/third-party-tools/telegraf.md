  Learn how to use Telegraf to collect system metrics and send this data to
  QuestDB.
---

[Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/) is a client for
collecting metrics from many inputs and has support for sending it on to various
outputs. It is plugin-driven for the collection and delivery of data, so it is
easily configurable and customizable. Telegraf is compiled as a standalone
binary, which means there are no external dependencies required to manage.

QuestDB supports ingesting from Telegraf over TCP. This page provides examples
for collecting CPU and memory usage metrics using Telegraf and sends these metrics
to a locally-running QuestDB instance for querying and visualization.

## Prerequisites

- **QuestDB** must be running and accessible. You can do so from
  [Docker](/docs/get-started/docker), the
  [binaries](/docs/get-started/binaries), or
  [Homebrew](/docs/get-started/homebrew) for macOS users.

- **Telegraf** can be installed using
  [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/telegraf),
  [docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf), or directly as a binary. For more
  details, refer to the official Telegraf
  [installation instructions](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/installation/).

## Configuring Telegraf

As Telegraf is a plugin-driven agent, the configuration file provided when
Telegraf is launched will determine which metrics to collect, if and how
processing of the metrics should be performed, and the destination outputs.

The default location that Telegraf can pick up configuration files is
`/usr/local/etc/` on macOS and `/etc/telegraf/` on Linux. After installation,
default configuration files are in the following locations:

- Homebrew install: `/usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf`
- Linux, Deb and RPM: `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`

Full configuration files for writing over TCP are provided below and can
be placed in these directories and picked up by Telegraf. To view a
comprehensive configuration file with example inputs and outputs, the following
command can generate an example:

```
telegraf -sample-config > example.conf
```

### Example Inputs

The examples on this page will use input plugins that read CPU and memory usage
statistics of the host machine and send this to the outputs specified in the
configuration file. The following snippet includes code comments which describe
the inputs in more detail:

```shell title="Example inputs sending host data to QuestDB"
...
# -- INPUT PLUGINS -- #
[[inputs.cpu]]
  # Read metrics about cpu usage
  ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
  percpu = true
  ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
  totalcpu = true
  ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics
  collect_cpu_time = false
  ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states
  report_active = false

# Read metrics about memory usage
[[inputs.mem]]
  # no customisation
```

## Writing to QuestDB over TCP

QuestDB expects influx line protocol messages over TCP on port `9009`. To change
the default port, see the
[InfluxDB line protocol (TCP)](/docs/reference/configuration#influxdb-line-protocol-tcp)
section of the server configuration page.

Create a new file named `questdb_tcp.conf` in one of the locations Telegraf can
load configuration files from and paste the following example:

```shell title="/path/to/telegraf/config/questdb_tcp.conf"
# Configuration for Telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "5s"
  hostname = "qdb"

# -- OUTPUT PLUGINS -- #
[[outputs.socket_writer]]
  # Write metrics to a local QuestDB instance over TCP
  address = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9009"

# -- INPUT PLUGINS -- #
[[inputs.cpu]]
  percpu = true
  totalcpu = true
  collect_cpu_time = false
  report_active = false
[[inputs.mem]]
  # no customisation
```

Run Telegraf and specify this config file with TCP writer settings:

```shell
telegraf --config questdb_tcp.conf
```

Telegraf should report the following if configured correctly:

```bash
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded inputs: cpu mem
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded aggregators:
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded processors:
2021-01-29T12:11:32Z I! Loaded outputs: socket_writer
...
```

## Verifying the integration

1. Navigate to the QuestDB Web Console at
   `http://127.0.0.1:9000/`. The Schema Navigator in the
   top left should display two new tables:

- `cpu` generated from `inputs.cpu`
- `mem` generated from `inputs.mem`

2. Type `cpu` in the query editor and click **RUN**

The `cpu` table will have a column for each metric collected by the Telegraf
plugin for monitoring memory:

### Graphing system CPU

To create a graph that visualizes CPU usage over time, run the following example
query:

```
SELECT
avg(usage_system) cpu_average,
max(usage_system) cpu_max,
timestamp
FROM cpu SAMPLE BY 1m;
```

Select the **Chart** tab and set the following values:

- Chart type **line**
- Labels **timestamp**
- Series **cpu_average** and **cpu_max**
