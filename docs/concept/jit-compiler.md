  Documentation for usage of the just-in-time (JIT) SQL compiler in QuestDB. JIT
  compilation enhances the performance of the system to run SQL queries which
  contain filters with arithmetical expressions.
---

QuestDB includes a JIT compiler which is run on queries (and sub-queries) that
perform a full scan over a table or table partitions. The main goal behind this
feature is to improve performance for filters with arithmetical expressions. To
do so, the JIT compiler emits machine code with a single function that may also
use SIMD (vector) instructions.

For details on the implementation, motivation, and internals of this feature,
see our [article about SQL JIT compilation](/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler).
This post describes our storage model, how we built a JIT compiler for SQL and
our plans for improving it in future.

## Queries eligible for JIT compilation

The types of queries that are eligible for performance improvements via JIT
compilation are those which contain `WHERE` clauses. Here are some examples
which are supported based on the `cpu-only` data set from the
[Time Series Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs/blob/master/docs/questdb.md)
use case:

```questdb-sql
-- basic filtering in WHERE clauses
SELECT count(), max(usage_user) FROM cpu WHERE usage_user > 75;

-- sub-queries
SELECT * FROM cpu
WHERE usage_user > 75
AND (region = 'us-west-1' OR region = 'us-east-1');
```

## JIT compiler usage

The JIT compiler is enabled by default for QuestDB 6.3 onwards. If you wish to
disable it, change the `cairo.sql.jit.mode` setting in the
[server configuration](/docs/reference/configuration) file from `on` to `off`:

```ini title="path/to/server.conf"
cairo.sql.jit.mode=off
```

Embedded API users are able to enable or disable the compiler globally by
providing their `CairoConfiguration` implementation. Alternatively, JIT
compilation can be changed for a single query by using the
`SqlExecutionContext#setJitMode` method. The latter may look like the following:

```java
final CairoConfiguration configuration = new DefaultCairoConfiguration(temp.getRoot().getAbsolutePath());
try (CairoEngine engine = new CairoEngine(configuration)) {
    final SqlExecutionContextImpl ctx = new SqlExecutionContextImpl(engine, 1);
    // Enable SQL JIT compiler
    ctx.setJitMode(SqlJitMode.JIT_MODE_ENABLED);
    // Subsequent query execution (called as usual) with have JIT enabled
    try (SqlCompiler compiler = new SqlCompiler(engine)) {
        try (RecordCursorFactory factory = compiler.compile("abc", ctx).getRecordCursorFactory()) {
            try (RecordCursor cursor = factory.getCursor(ctx)) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Server logs should contain references to `SQL JIT compiler mode`:

```log
2021-12-16T09:25:34.472450Z A server-main SQL JIT compiler mode: on
```

Due to certain limitations noted below, JIT compilation won't take place for all
queries. To understand whether JIT compilation took place for a query, one will
see something similar in the server logs:

```log
2021-12-16T09:35:01.738910Z I i.q.g.SqlCompiler plan [q=`select-group-by count() count from (select [usage_user] from cpu timestamp (timestamp) where usage_user > 75)`, fd=73]
2021-12-16T09:35:01.742777Z I i.q.g.SqlCodeGenerator JIT enabled for (sub)query [tableName=cpu, fd=73]
```

## Known limitations

The current implementation of the JIT SQL compiler has a number of limitations:

- Only x86-64 CPUs are currently supported.
- Vectorized filter execution requires AVX2 instruction set.
- Filters with any SQL function, such as `now()`, or `abs()`, or `round()`, are
  not supported.
- Filters with any pseudo-function or operator, such as `in()` on symbol column,
  or `between` on non-designated timestamp column, or `within` on geohash
  column, are not supported.
- Only the following arithmetic operations are allowed to be present in the
  filter: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Only filters with fixed-size columns are supported: BOOLEAN, BYTE, GEOBYTE,
  SHORT, GEOSHORT, CHAR, INT, GEOINT, SYMBOL, FLOAT, LONG, GEOLONG, DATE,
  TIMESTAMP, DOUBLE.
