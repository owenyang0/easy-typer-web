The `timestamp_sequence()` function may be used as a timestamp generator to
create data for testing. Pseudo-random steps can be achieved by providing a
[random function](/docs/reference/function/random-value-generator) to the
`step` argument. A `seed` value may be provided to a random function if the
randomly-generated `step` should be deterministic.

## timestamp_sequence

- `timestamp_sequence(startTimestamp, step)` generates a sequence of `timestamp`
  starting at `startTimestamp`, and incrementing by a `step` set as a `long`
  value in microseconds. This `step` can be either;

  - a static value, in which case the growth will be monotonic, or

  - a randomized value, in which case the growth will be randomized. This is
    done using
    [random value generator functions](/docs/reference/function/random-value-generator).

**Arguments:**

- `startTimestamp`: is a `timestamp` representing the starting (i.e lowest)
  generated timestamp in the sequence.
- `step`: is a `long` representing the interval between 2 consecutive generated
  timestamps in `microseconds`.

**Return value:**

Return value type is `timestamp`.

**Examples:**

```questdb-sql title="Monotonic timestamp increase"
SELECT x, timestamp_sequence(
            to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'),
            100000L)
FROM long_sequence(5);
```

| x   | timestamp_sequence          |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.000000Z |
| 2   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.100000Z |
| 3   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.200000Z |
| 4   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.300000Z |
| 5   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.400000Z |

```questdb-sql title="Randomized timestamp increase"
SELECT x, timestamp_sequence(
            to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'),
            rnd_short(1,5) * 100000L)
FROM long_sequence(5);
```

| x   | timestamp_sequence          |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| 1   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.000000Z |
| 2   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.100000Z |
| 3   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.600000Z |
| 4   | 2019-10-17T00:00:00.900000Z |
| 5   | 2019-10-17T00:00:01.300000Z |
