`timestamp(columnName)` elects a
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp):

- during a [CREATE TABLE](/docs/reference/sql/create-table#timestamp) operation
- during a [SELECT](/docs/reference/sql/select#timestamp) operation
  (`dynamic timestamp`)
- when ingesting data via ILP, for tables that do not already exist in QuestDB,
  partitions are applied automatically by day by default with a `timestamp`
  column

:::info

- Checking if tables contain a designated timestamp column can be done via the
  `tables()` and `table_columns()` functions which are described in the
  [meta functions](/docs/reference/function/meta) documentation page.

- The native timestamp format used by QuestDB is a Unix timestamp in microsecond
  resolution. See
  [Timestamps in QuestDB](/docs/guides/working-with-timestamps-timezones#timestamps-in-questdb)
  for more details.

## Syntax

### During a CREATE operation

Create a [designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp) column
during table creation. For more information, refer to the
[CREATE TABLE](/docs/reference/sql/create-table) section.

### During a SELECT operation

Creates a [designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp) column in
the result of a query. Assigning a timestamp in a `SELECT` statement
(`dynamic timestamp`) allows for time series operations such as `LATEST BY`,
`SAMPLE BY` or `LATEST BY` on tables which do not have a `designated timestamp`
assigned.

## Examples

### During a CREATE operation

The following creates a table with
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp).

```questdb-sql title="Create table"
CREATE TABLE
temperatures(ts timestamp, sensorID symbol, sensorLocation symbol, reading double)
timestamp(ts);
```

### During a SELECT operation

The following will query a table and assign a
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp) to the output. Note
the use of brackets to ensure the timestamp clause is applied to the result of
the query instead of the whole `readings` table.

```questdb-sql title="Dynamic timestamp"
(SELECT cast(dateTime AS TIMESTAMP) ts, device, value FROM readings) timestamp(ts);
```

Although the `readings` table does not have a designated timestamp, we are able
to create one on the fly. Now, we can use this into a subquery to perform
timestamp operations.

```questdb-sql title="Dynamic timestamp subquery"
SELECT ts, avg(value) FROM
(SELECT cast(dateTime AS TIMESTAMP) ts, value FROM readings) timestamp(ts)
SAMPLE BY 1d;
```

If the data is unordered, it is important to order it first.

```questdb-sql title="Dynamic timestamp - unordered data"
SELECT ts, avg(value) FROM
(SELECT ts, value FROM unordered_readings ORDER BY ts) timestamp(ts)
SAMPLE BY 1d;
```
