## Quickstart

Add a QuestDB as a dependency to your build project:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<Tabs
  defaultValue="maven"
  values={[
    { label: "Maven", value: "maven" },
    { label: "Gradle", value: "gradle" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="maven">
    <InterpolateReleaseData
      renderText={(release) => (
        <CodeBlock className="language-xml">
          {`<dependency>
  <groupId>org.questdb</groupId>
  <artifactId>questdb</artifactId>
  <version>${release.name}</version>
</dependency>`}
        </CodeBlock>
      )}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gradle">
    <InterpolateReleaseData
      renderText={(release) => (
        <CodeBlock className="language-text">
          {`compile group: 'org.questdb', name: 'questdb', version: '${release.name}'`}
        </CodeBlock>
      )}
    />
  </TabItem>

The code bellow creates an instance of a client, configures it to connect to a
QuestDB server running on localhost on a TCP port 9009. Then it sends two rows,
each with one [symbol](/docs/concept/symbol/), long column and one string
column. It instructs the QuestDB server to assign a timestamp by using a local
wall-clock.

<RemoteRepoExample name="ilp" lang="java" header={false} />

## Example with TLS and Authentication enabled

This sample configures a client to use TLS encryption for a connection to a
QuestDB server. It also instructs the client to authenticate.

<RemoteRepoExample name="ilp-auth-tls" lang="java" header={false} />

This configuration also works with [QuestDB Cloud](https://questdb.io/cloud/).
If you are using a self-managed QuestDB with
[authentication enabled](/docs/reference/api/ilp/authenticate) then `authToken`
is the `d` portion of a JWK.

## General usage pattern

1. Create a client instance via `Sender.builder()`.
2. Use `table(CharSequence)` to select a table for inserting a new row.
3. Use `symbol(CharSequence, CharSequence)` to add all symbols. You must add
   symbols before adding other column type.
4. Use the following options to add all the remaining columns:

   - `stringColumn(CharSequence, CharSequence)`
   - `longColumn(CharSequence, long)`
   - `doubleColumn(CharSequence, double)`
   - `boolColumn(CharSequence, boolean)`
   - `timestampColumn(CharSequence, long)`

5. Use `at(long)` or `atNow()` to set a designated timestamp.
6. Optionally: You can use `flush()` to send locally buffered data into a
   server.
7. Go to the step no. 2 to start a new row.
8. Use `close()` to dispose the Sender after you no longer need it.

## Designated timestamp considerations

The following options determine how a
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp/) is assigned:

- `atNow()` automatically assigns a timestamp based on a server wall-clock upon
  receiving a row.
- `at(long)` assigns a specific timestamp.

The code samples above use QuestDB to assign timestamp automatically: `atNow()`
instructs the server to assign a timestamp by using a local wall-clock. To
assign a specific timestamp, use `at(long)` instead of `atNow()`.

:::note

QuestDB works best when rows are ingested in chronological order. This means
rows with older timestamps are ingested before rows with newer timestamps.

Receiving out-of-order data can have a performance impact:

- For QuestDB 6.6 and later versions, the out-of-order data ingestion has been
  optimized and automated.

- For QuestDB 6.5.5 and earlier versions, users need to configure
  [Out-of-order commit lag](/docs/guides/out-of-order-commit-lag) setting.

:::

Please note that the client does not interpret the timestamp in any way. It
merely passes the timestamp to a server, and it is up to the server to interpret
the timestamp. The default behavior of a QuestDB server is to treat the
designated timestamp as a number of nanoseconds since 1st Jan 1970 UTC. See
[Timestamps](/docs/develop/insert-data/#timestamps) for more details.

:::caution

By default, QuestDB's engine treats a designated timestamp as nanoseconds, but
this does not mean that `System.nanoTime()` can be used to get the current time
and pass it to `at(long)`. `System.nanoTime()` is only useful for measuring
elapsed time, and it is not related to any notion of system or wall-clock time.

:::

## Other considerations

- The Sender is not thread-safe. For multiple threads to send data to QuestDB,
  each thread should have its own Sender instance. An object pool can also be
  used to re-use Sender instances.
- The Sender instance has to be closed after it is no longer in use. The Sender
  implements the `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface, and therefore the
  [try-with-resource](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)
  pattern can be used to ensure that the Sender is closed.
- A client buffers row data internally and sends them to a server in batches
  when the buffer is full. This improves performance significantly, but it also
  means that during a period of quiescence, some written rows may be retained in
  the buffer and are not sent to a server until the buffer are full.
- The method `flush()` can be called to force sending the internal buffer to a
  server, even when the buffer is not full yet.

## Configuration

The client offers a builder API to configure all supported options. See
`Sender.builder()`.

## Limitations

The client supports TCP only. It does not support UDP as transport.
