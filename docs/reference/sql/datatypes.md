The type system is derived from Java types.

| Type Name         | Storage bits | Nullable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Variable-sized type limitations

`BINARY` field size is limited either by 64-Bit signed int (8388608 peta bytes)
or disk size, whichever is smaller.

`STRING` field size is limited by either 32-bit signed int (1073741824
characters) or disk size, whichever is smaller.

## Type nullability

Nullable types use a specific value to mark `NULL` values:

| Type Name        | Null value                                                           | Description                                                                                                            |

| `double`         | `NaN`                                                                | As defined by IEEE 754 (`java.lang.Double.NaN`).                                                                       |

| `long`           | `0x8000000000000000L`                                                | Minimum possible value a `long` can take -2^63.                                                                        |
| `date`           | `0x8000000000000000L`                                                | Minimum possible value a `long` can take -2^63.                                                                        |
| `timestamp`      | `0x8000000000000000L`                                                | Minimum possible value a `long` can take -2^63.                                                                        |

| `char`           | `0x0000`                                                             | 0.                                                                                                                     |
| `geohash(byte)`  | `0xff`                                                               | Geohashes `from 1 up to included 7 bits`.                                                                              |
| `geohash(short)` | `0xffff`                                                             | Geohashes `from 8 up to included 15 bits`.                                                                             |
| `geohash(int)`   | `0xffffffff`                                                         | Geohashes `from 16 up to included 31 bits`.                                                                            |
| `geohash(long)`  | `0xffffffffffffffff`                                                 | Geohashes `from 32 up to included 60 bits`.                                                                            |
| `symbol`         | `0x80000000`                                                         | Symbols are stored as `int` offsets in a lookup file.                                                                  |
| `string`         | `0xffffffff`                                                         | Strings are length prefixed, the length is an `int` and `-1` marks it `NULL` (no further storage is used).             |
| `binary`         | `0xffffffffffffffff`                                                 | Binary columns are also length prefixed, the length is a `long` and `-1` marks it `NULL` (no further storage is used). |

To filter columns that contain, or don't contain, `NULL` values use a filter
like:

```questdb-sql
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> = NULL;
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> != NULL;
```

Alternatively, from version 6.3 use the NULL equality operator aliases:

```questdb-sql
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> IS NULL;
SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL;
```

:::note
`NULL` values still occupy disk space.

## The UUID type

QuestDB natively supports the `UUID` type, which should be used for `UUID`
columns instead of storing `UUIDs` as `strings`. `UUID` columns are internally
stored as 128-bit integers, allowing more efficient performance particularly in
filtering and sorting. Strings inserted into a `UUID` column is permitted but
the data will be converted to the `UUID` type.

```questdb-sql title="Inserting strings into a UUID column"
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id UUID
);
[...]
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES ('a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11');
[...]
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = 'a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11';
```

If you use the [PGWire protocol](/docs/reference/api/postgres/) then you can use the `uuid` type in your queries.
The JDBC API does not distinguish the UUID type, but the Postgres JDBC driver
supports it in prepared statements:

```java
UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement("INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (?)");
ps.setObject(1, uuid);
```

[QuestDB ILP clients](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/clients/overview/) can
send `UUIDs` as `strings` to be converted to UUIDs by the server.
