Type conversion. Can be either:

- [Explicit](#explicit-conversion) via `cast()`
- [Implicit](#implicit-conversion), in which case it will be automatically
  performed when required by the context.

## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the CAST keyword](/img/docs/diagrams/cast.svg)

where:

- `expression` can be a constant, a column, or an expression that evaluates to a
  value.
- `type` refers to the desired [data type](/docs/reference/sql/datatypes).

`cast` can be used a part of arithmetic expression as normal

## Explicit conversion

Types can be converted from one to another using the `cast()` function.

## Examples

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT
cast(3L + 2L AS INT),
cast(1578506142000000 AS TIMESTAMP),
cast('10.2' AS DOUBLE),
cast('è¡Œ' AS INT);
```

| cast | cast1                       | cast2 | cast3 |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 5    | 2020-01-08T17:55:42.000000Z | 10.2  | 34892 |

Explicit casting of an expression to a smaller
[data type](/docs/reference/sql/datatypes) may result in loss of data when the
output data type is smaller than the expression.

- Casting a decimal number type (`float` or `double`) to an integer number type
  (`long`, `int`, `short`) will result in decimals drop.
- If the integer part being cast is larger than the resulting data type, it will
  be resized by truncating bits.
- Conversions from `char` to a number type will return the corresponding
  `unicode` number and vice versa.

### Precision loss examples

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT
cast(3.5 + 2 AS INT),
cast(7234623 AS SHORT),
cast(2334444.323 AS SHORT);
```

| cast | cast1 | cast2  |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| 5    | 25663 | -24852 |

When casting numbers into a smaller data type, QuestDB will truncate the higher
bits of this number.

## Implicit conversion

Type casting may be necessary in certain context such as

- Operations involving various different types
- Inserting values where the originating type is different from the destination
  column type.

QuestDB will attempt to convert to the data type required by the context. This
is called `implicit cast` and does not require using the `cast()` function.

:::note

QuestDB will only perform implicit cast when they would not result in data being
truncated or precision being lost.

The below chart illustrates the explicit and implicit cast available in QuestDB.

![Table showing the different possibilities the cast function supports, those are defined by an input and output types](/img/docs/castmap.jpg)

:::note

Implicit casting prevents data loss. When an operation involves multiple types,
the resulting type will be the smallest possible type so that no data is lost.

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT
1234L + 567,
1234L + 0.567,
to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss') + 323,
to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss') + 0.323;
```
