`WHERE` clause filters data. Filter expressions are required to return boolean
result.

:::info

QuestDB includes a JIT compiler for SQL queries which contain `WHERE` clauses.
To find out more about this functionality with details on enabling its use, see
the [JIT compiler documentation](/docs/concept/jit-compiler).

:::

## Syntax

The general syntax is as follows. Specific filters have distinct syntaxes
detailed thereafter.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause](/img/docs/diagrams/where.svg)

### Logical operators

QuestDB supports `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` as logical operators and can assemble
conditions using brackets `()`.

![Flow chart showing the detailed syntax of the WHERE clause](/img/docs/diagrams/whereComplex.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Example"
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE
a = 1 AND (b = 2 OR c = 3 AND NOT d);
```

## Symbol and string

QuestDB can filter strings and symbols based on equality, inequality, and
regular expression patterns.

### Exact match

Evaluates match of a string or symbol.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a string comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereExactString.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Example"
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name = 'John';
```

| name | age |
| ---- | --- |
| John | 31  |
| John | 45  |
| ...  | ... |

### Does NOT match

Evaluates mismatch of a string or symbol.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a string comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereStringNotMatch.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Example"
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name != 'John';
```

| name | age |
| ---- | --- |
| Tim  | 31  |
| Tom  | 45  |
| ...  | ... |

### Regular expression match

Evaluates match against a regular expression defined using
[java.util.regex](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
patterns.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a regex comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereRegexMatch.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Regex example"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ~ 'Jo';
```

| name     | age |
| -------- | --- |
| Joe      | 31  |
| Jonathan | 45  |
| ...      | ... |

### Regular expression does NOT match

Evaluates mismatch against a regular expression defined using
[java.util.regex](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
patterns.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a regex comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereRegexNotMatch.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Example"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name !~ 'Jo';
```

| name | age |
| ---- | --- |
| Tim  | 31  |
| Tom  | 45  |
| ...  | ... |

### List search

Evaluates match or mismatch against a list of elements.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a list comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereListIn.svg)

```questdb-sql title="List match"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name in('Tim', 'Tom');
```

| name | age |
| ---- | --- |
| Tim  | 31  |
| Tom  | 45  |
| ...  | ... |

```questdb-sql title="List mismatch"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE NOT name in('Tim', 'Tom');
```

| name   | age |
| ------ | --- |
| Aaron  | 31  |
| Amelie | 45  |
| ...    | ... |

## Numeric

QuestDB can filter numeric values based on equality, inequality, comparison, and
proximity.

:::note

For timestamp filters, we recommend the
[timestamp search notation](#timestamp-and-date) which is faster and less
verbose.

:::

### Equality, inequality and comparison

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a numeric comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereNumericValue.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Superior or equal to 23"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age >= 23;
```

```questdb-sql title="Equal to 23"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 23;
```

```questdb-sql title="NOT Equal to 23"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age != 23;
```

<!-- 
QuestDB does not support `eq()`. This section is therefore commented out and can be uncommented when we add the functionality.
### Proximity

Evaluates whether the column value is within a range of the target value. This
is useful to simulate equality on `double` and `float` values.

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with an EQ comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereEqDoublePrecision.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Equal to 23 with 0.00001 precision"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE eq(age, 23, 0.00001);
```

:::tip

When performing multiple equality checks of double values against integer
constants, it may be preferable to store double values as long integers with a
scaling factor.

:::
-->

## Boolean

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a boolean comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereBoolean.svg)

Using the columnName will return `true` values. To return `false` values,
precede the column name with the `NOT` operator.

```questdb-sql title="Example - true"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE isActive;
```

| userId | isActive |
| ------ | -------- |
| 12532  | true     |
| 38572  | true     |
| ...    | ...      |

```questdb-sql title="Example - false"
SELECT * FROM users WHERE NOT isActive;
```

| userId | isActive |
| ------ | -------- |
| 876534 | false    |
| 43234  | false    |
| ...    | ...      |

## Timestamp and date

QuestDB supports both its own timestamp search notation and standard search
based on inequality. This section describes the use of the **timestamp search
notation** which is efficient and fast but requires a
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp).

If a table does not have a designated timestamp applied during table creation,
one may be applied dynamically
[during a select operation](/docs/reference/function/timestamp#during-a-select-operation).

### Native timestamp format

QuestDB automatically recognizes strings formatted as ISO timestamp as a
`timestamp` type. The following are valid examples of strings parsed as
`timestamp` types:

| Valid STRING Format              | Resulting Timestamp         |

### Exact timestamp

#### Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a timestamp comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereTimestampExact.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Timestamp equals date"
SELECT scores WHERE ts = '2010-01-12T00:02:26.000Z';
```

| ts                       | score |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| 2010-01-12T00:02:26.000Z | 2.4   |
| 2010-01-12T00:02:26.000Z | 3.1   |
| ...                      | ...   |

```questdb-sql title="Timestamp equals timestamp"
SELECT scores WHERE ts = '2010-01-12T00:02:26.000000Z';
```

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2010-01-12T00:02:26.000000Z | 2.4   |
| 2010-01-12T00:02:26.000000Z | 3.1   |
| ...                         | ...   |

### Time range

Returns results within a defined range.

#### Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a partial timestamp comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereTimestampPartial.svg)

```questdb-sql title="Results in a given year"
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE ts IN '2018';
```

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:0000.000000Z  | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2018-12-31T23:59:59.999999Z | 115.8 |

```questdb-sql title="Results in a given minute"
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE ts IN '2018-05-23T12:15';
```

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-05-23T12:15:00.000000Z | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2018-05-23T12:15:59.999999Z | 115.8 |

### Time range with modifier

You can apply a modifier to further customize the range. The modifier extends
the upper bound of the original timestamp based on the modifier parameter. An
optional interval with occurrence can be set, to apply the search in the given
time range repeatedly, for a set number of times.

#### Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the WHERE clause with a timestamp/modifier comparison](/img/docs/diagrams/whereTimestampIntervalSearch.svg)

- `timestamp` is the original time range for the query.
- `modifier` is an unsigned integer modifying the upper bound applying to the
`timestamp`.
<!--change to signed when this is merged: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/2509

  - A `positive` value extends the selected period.
  - A `negative` value reduces the selected period.
-->

- `interval` is an unsigned integer indicating the desired interval period for
  the time range.
- `repetition` is an unsigned integer indicating the number of times the
  interval should be applied.

#### Examples

Modifying the range:

```questdb-sql title="Results in a given year and the first month of the next year"
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE ts IN '2018;1M';
```

The range is 2018. The modifier extends the upper bound (originally 31 Dec 2018)
by one month.

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2019-01-31T23:59:59.999999Z | 115.8 |

<!--
https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/2509
```questdb-sql title="Results in a given month excluding the last 3 days"
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE ts IN '2018-01;-3d';
```

The range is Jan 2018. The modifier reduces the upper bound (originally 31
Jan 2018) by 3 days.

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2018-01-28T23:59:59.999999Z | 113.8 |
-->


Modifying the interval:

```questdb-sql title="Results on a given date with an interval"
SELECT * FROM scores WHERE ts IN '2018-01-01;1d;1y;2';

```

The range is extended by one day from Jan 1 2018, with a one-year interval,
repeated twice. This means that the query searches for results on Jan 1-2 in
2018 and in 2019:

| ts                          | score |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2018-01-02T23:59:59.999999Z | 110.3 |
| 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z | 128.7 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2019-01-02T23:59:59.999999Z | 103.8 |

### IN with multiple arguments

#### Syntax

`IN` with more than 1 argument is treated as standard SQL `IN`. It is a
shorthand of multiple `OR` conditions, i.e. the following query:

```questdb-sql title="IN list"
SELECT * FROM scores
WHERE ts IN ('2018-01-01', '2018-01-01T12:00', '2018-01-02');
```

is equivalent to:

```questdb-sql title="IN list equivalent OR"
SELECT * FROM scores
WHERE ts = '2018-01-01' or ts = '2018-01-01T12:00' or ts = '2018-01-02');
```

| ts                          | value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z | 123.4 |
| 2018-01-01T12:00:00.000000Z | 589.1 |
| 2018-01-02T00:00:00.000000Z | 131.5 |

### BETWEEN

#### Syntax

For non-standard ranges, users can explicitly specify the target range using the
`BETWEEN` operator. As with standard SQL, both upper and lower bounds of
`BETWEEN` are inclusive, and the order of lower and upper bounds is not
important so that `BETWEEN X AND Y` is equivalent to `BETWEEN Y AND X`.

```questdb-sql title="Explicit range"
SELECT * FROM scores
WHERE ts BETWEEN '2018-01-01T00:00:23.000000Z' AND '2018-01-01T00:00:23.500000Z';
```

| ts                          | value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:23.000000Z | 123.4 |
| ...                         | ...   |
| 2018-01-01T00:00:23.500000Z | 131.5 |

`BETWEEN` can accept non-constant bounds, for example, the following query will
return all records older than one year before the current date:

```questdb-sql title="One year before current date"
SELECT * FROM scores
WHERE ts BETWEEN to_str(now(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')
AND dateadd('y', -1, to_str(now(), 'yyyy-MM-dd'));
```
