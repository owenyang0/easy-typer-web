Prepares the database for a filesystem (disk) snapshot.

:::warning

Snapshot statements are not supported on Windows OS.

## Syntax

![Flow chart showing the syntax of the SNAPSHOT keyword](/img/docs/diagrams/snapshot.svg)

## Snapshot process

Snapshot recovery mechanism requires a **snapshot instance ID** to be specified
using the `cairo.snapshot.instance.id`
[configuration key](/docs/reference/configuration):

```shell title="server.conf"
cairo.snapshot.instance.id=your_id
```

A snapshot instance ID may be an arbitrary string value, such as string
representation of a UUID.

Collecting a snapshot of the database involves the following steps:

1. Run `SNAPSHOT PREPARE` statement to acquire reader locks for all database
   tables, create table metadata file copies in the `snapshot` directory, and
   flush the committed data to disk.
2. Start a filesystem snapshot. Refer to the
   [next section](#filesystem-snapshot) to learn how to create a filesystem
   snapshot on the most common cloud providers.
3. Run `SNAPSHOT COMPLETE` statement to release the reader locks and delete the
   metadata file copies.

For some cloud vendors, snapshot creation operation is asynchronous, i.e. the
point-in-time snapshot is created immediately, as soon as the operation starts,
but the end snapshot artifact may become available later. In such case, the
`SNAPSHOT COMPLETE` statement (step 3) may be run without waiting for the end
artifact, but once the snapshot creation has started.

:::info

No DDL statements, such as `ALTER TABLE my_table DROP COLUMN my_col`, should be
run in parallel with the above steps. Otherwise, the snapshot may contain
corrupted metadata making it unusable.

## Filesystem snapshot

The most common ways to perform cloud-native filesystem snapshots are described
in the following resources, which rely on similar steps but have minor
differences in terminology and services:

- [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html) -
  creating EBS snapshots
- [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/snapshot-copy-managed-disk?tabs=portal) -
  creating snapshots of a virtual hard disk
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots) - working
  with persistent disk snapshots

## Snapshot recovery

To start the database on a filesystem snapshot, you should make sure to
configure a different snapshot instance ID.

When the database starts, it checks the current instance ID and the ID stored in
the `snapshot` directory, if present. On IDs mismatch, the database runs a
snapshot recovery procedure restoring the metadata files from the snapshot. When
this happens, you should see something like the following in the server logs:

```
2022-03-07T08:24:12.348004Z I i.q.g.DatabaseSnapshotAgent starting snapshot recovery [currentId=`id2`, previousId=`id1`]
...
2022-03-07T08:24:12.349922Z I i.q.g.DatabaseSnapshotAgent snapshot recovery finished [metaFilesCount=1, txnFilesCount=1, cvFilesCount=1]
```

Snapshot recovery can be disabled using the `cairo.snapshot.recovery.enabled`
configuration key:

```shell title="server.conf"
cairo.snapshot.recovery.enabled=false
```

## Examples

```questdb-sql
SNAPSHOT PREPARE;
-- Start a filesystem snapshot.
SNAPSHOT COMPLETE;
```
