This guide describes how to run QuestDB on a Compute Engine instance on Google
Cloud platform with details on how to enable networking on various interfaces by
means of firewall rules.

This guide uses the official QuestDB Docker image during VM instance creation to
simplify setup steps for a quick, robust deployment. The networking rules below
show how to make ports for PostgreSQL wire protocol and REST API publicly
accessible or by whitelisted IP.

## Prerequisites

- A [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started)
  (GCP) account and a GCP Project
- The
  [Compute Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com)
  must be enabled for the corresponding Google Cloud Platform project

## Create a Compute Engine VM

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to
   [Compute Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) and
   click **Create Instance**

/>

2. Give the instance a name, this example uses `questdb-europe-west3`
3. Choose a **Region** and **Zone**, this example uses
   `europe-west3 (Frankfurt)` and the default zone
4. Choose a machine configuration, a general-purpose instance is `e2-medium`
   with 4GB memory
5. Enable the checkbox under **Container** and provide the latest QuestDB Docker
   image:

   ```text
   questdb/questdb:latest
   ```

Given the steps so far, the VM Instance configuration page should look like the
following:

/>

Before creating the instance, assign a **Network tag** so that a firewall rule
for networking can be easily applied to instances of the same type.

1. Expand the menu item **Management, security, disks, networking, sole
   tenancy** towards the bottom of the page
2. In the **Networking** panel add a **Network tag** to identify the instance,
   this example uses `questdb`
3. Launch the instance by clicking **Create**

  width={650}
/>

## Create a firewall rule

1. Navigate to the
   [Firewalls configuration](https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/firewalls)
   page under **VPC network** -> **Firewalls**
2. Add the target tag `questdb`
3. Choose an IP range that this rule applies to, this example uses `0.0.0.0/0`
   (i.e. any IP)
4. In the **Protocols and ports** section, enable `8812` and `9000` for TCP.
5. Click **create**

/>

All VM instances on Compute Engine within this account which have the **Network
tag** `questdb` will have this firewall rule applied.

:::info

The configuration above allows networking from any IP address for the selected
ports. A more secure approach would be to only allow incoming connections from
whitelisted IPs.

The ports we have opened are

- `9000` for the REST API and Web Console
- `8812` for PostgreSQL wire protocol

## Verify the deployment

To verify the instance state, navigate to **Compute Engine** ->
[VM Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances). A status
indicator should show the instance as **running**:

  width={650}
/>

To verify that the QuestDB deployment is operating as expected:

1. Copy the **External IP** of the instance
2. Navigate to `<external_ip>:9000` in a browser

The Web Console should be visible:

  width={650}
/>

Alternatively, a request may be sent against the REST API exposed on port 9000:

```bash
curl -G \
  --data-urlencode "query=SELECT * FROM telemetry_config" \
  <external_ip>:9000/exec
```
