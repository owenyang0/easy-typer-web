  How to employ a data retention strategy to delete old data and save disk space
---

## Background

The nature of time-series data is that the relevance of information diminishes
over time. If stale data is no longer required, users can delete old data from
QuestDB to either save disk space or adhere to a data retention policy. This is
achieved in QuestDB by removing data partitions from a table.

This page provides a high-level overview of partitioning with examples to drop
data by date. For more details on partitioning, see the
[partitioning](/docs/concept/partitions) page.

## Strategy for data retention

A simple approach to removing stale data is to drop data that has been
partitioned by time. A table must have a
[designated timestamp](/docs/concept/designated-timestamp) assigned and a
partitioning strategy specified during a `CREATE TABLE` operation to achieve
this.

:::note

Users cannot alter the partitioning strategy after a table is created.

:::

Tables can be partitioned by one of the following:

- `YEAR`
- `MONTH`
- `DAY`
- `HOUR`

```questdb-sql title="Creating a table and partitioning by DAY"
CREATE TABLE my_table(ts TIMESTAMP, symb SYMBOL, price DOUBLE) timestamp(ts)
PARTITION BY DAY;
```

### Dropping partitions

:::caution

Use `DROP PARTITION` with care, as QuestDB **cannot recover data from dropped
partitions**.

:::

To drop partitions, users can use the
[ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-drop-partition)
syntax. Partitions may be dropped by:

- `DROP PARTITION LIST` - specifying a comma-separated list of partitions to
  drop

  ```questdb-sql
  --Delete a partition
  ALTER TABLE my_table DROP PARTITION LIST '2021-01-01';

  --Delete a list of two partitions
  ALTER TABLE my_table DROP PARTITION LIST '2021-01-01', '2021-01-02';
  ```

- `WHERE timestamp =` - exact date matching by timestamp

  ```questdb-sql
  ALTER TABLE my_table DROP PARTITION
  WHERE timestamp = to_timestamp('2021-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd');
  ```

- `WHERE timestamp <` - using comparison operators (`<` / `>`) to delete by time
  range relative to a timestamp. Note that the `now()` function may be used to
  automate dropping of partitions relative to the current time, i.e.:

  ```questdb-sql
  --Drop partitions older than 30 days
  WHERE timestamp < dateadd('d', -30, now())
  ```

**Usage notes:**

- The most chronologically recent partition cannot be deleted
- Arbitrary partitions may be dropped, which means they may not be the oldest
  chronologically. Depending on the types of queries users are performing on a
  dataset, it may not be desirable to have gaps caused by dropped partitions.

### Example

The following example demonstrates how to create a table with partitioning and
to drop partitions based on time. This example produces 5 days' worth of data
with one incrementing `LONG` value inserted per hour.

```questdb-sql title="Create a partitioned table and generate data"
CREATE TABLE my_table (timestamp TIMESTAMP, x LONG) timestamp(timestamp)
PARTITION BY DAY;

INSERT INTO my_table
SELECT timestamp_sequence(
    to_timestamp('2021-01-01T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'),100000L * 36000), x
FROM long_sequence(120);
```

For reference, the following functions are used to generate the example data:

- [timestamp sequence](/docs/reference/function/timestamp-generator#timestamp_sequence)
  with 1 hour stepping
- [row generator](/docs/reference/function/row-generator#long_sequence) with
  `long_sequence()` function which creates a `x:long` column

The result of partitioning is visible when listing as directories on disk:

```bash title="path/to/<QuestDB-root>/db"
my_table
├── 2021-01-01
├── 2021-01-02
├── 2021-01-03
├── 2021-01-04
└── 2021-01-05
```

Partitions can be dropped using the following query:

```
--Delete days before 2021-01-03
ALTER TABLE my_table DROP PARTITION
WHERE timestamp < to_timestamp('2021-01-03', 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```
