This folder contains files that represent website routes.

For example, `src/pages/about-us.tsx` will be a page reachable with `https://questdb.io/about-us`.

The content of files here should be lightweight and only define the
content and its order. There should not be any framework specific
details or big react components. These should go into either
`src/modules`, `src/components` or `src/theme`
