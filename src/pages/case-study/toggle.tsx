          <h3>Description of Toggle use case with QuestDB</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Toggle uses AI & Machine Learning to help investors extract insights
            on their portfolio & investments. The system distills billions of
            data points into alerts like “Analyst expectations are turning
            negative for AAPL; historically, this led to outperformance of the
            stock.” As you can imagine, this sort of system requires a
            tremendous amount of timeseries data — prices, fundamentals,
            sentiment, etc. All of this data is stored as a series and needs to
            be easily accessible for analysis by our models. It is critical that
            every step in the process is optimized.
          </p>

          <h3>Improvements over InfluxDB</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Toggle utilized many databases, including Mongo, Cassandra, and
            TimescaleDB. After much testing, they settled on InfluxDB, as it had
            the best performance. As the company was growing, performance
            started to degrade, and it became expensive to run. They had a small
            cluster of 4 x m4.2xlarge machines, and memory on all 4 was often at
            least 80%, hitting 100% a few times per week. Modeling out the
            future infrastructure spend based on this baseline, InfluxDB wasn’t
            a viable option as the company scaled.
          </p>

          <h3>The process to migrate data from InfluxDB to QuestDB</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            When evaluating a new solution, Toggle knew that they had to answer
            the following questions:
          </p>

          <ul className="font-size--large">
            <li>Can we move the data seamlessly and promptly?</li>
            <li>
              Can we query a sample of our data with at least the response times
              of InfluxDB?
            </li>
            <li>Can we ingest new data seamlessly?</li>
            <li>Can we create time series on the fly?</li>
            <li>
              Can we maintain the performance that we have today after we’ve
              imported all of our data?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Of all the possible solutions evaluated, QuestDB was the only one
            that met all of our criteria.
          </p>

          <h3>A side by side comparison of QuestDB vs. InfluxDB</h3>
          <ul className="font-size--large">
            <li>
              InfluxDB on a cluster of 4 machines (m4.2xlarge with 128GiB of
              RAM) was averaging a response time of over 5 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a few weeks with QuestDB in production (still with a single
              machine), the performance averaged 15 milliseconds, i.e., more
              than 300x faster queries.
              <Image
                alt="Chart showing the average transaction duration for QuestDB on a given day"
                height={433}
                src="/img/pages/case-study/toggle/chart.png"
                width={791}
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              The virtual machine’s stats indicated that the servers were never
              overtaxed (user: 17%, system: 4%).
            </li>
            <li>
              Direct cost reduction (¼ of the machines) and performance
              improvements meant that Toggle could do much more for less.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-size--large">
            The actual data migration was easy with a script to read from one
            side & ingest in the other. Toggle imported over 600 million data
            points in a few minutes.
